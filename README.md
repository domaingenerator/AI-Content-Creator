Dont waste money on these AI content generator tools, they just use OpenAI anyway which is so much cheaper in comparison. 
This tool you can self host and start to generate content just like those $50 a month tools. 

## Features
Here are some of the great features that have been built into this tool

### Search engine page analysis
See the top search results for a keyword and analyse the word count, post outlines and meta description. The tool also calculates the recommended word count for a blog post targeting the keyword

### Generate content
Using OpenAI, you can simple write commands into the input box that will query the OpenAI platform and send back results. For example, do you need to generate some blog title ideas, simple input "Generate blog topics on building backlinks for your website" and the tool will return ideas. 

### Self host the tool
No need for any fancy hosting, just use cpanel nodejs hosting. Most cpanel hosting includes Nodejs, just upload the files, add your environment variables and away you go. 

## Requirements
 - OpenAI account. You can use the free $17 trial and then upgrade to a pay as you go.
 - Web hosting. A2hosting shared hosting is recommended and has been tested.
