Simple Steps To Using The Domain Name Generator Insert   Insert targeted keywords in the search bar Filter   Filter results based on your preferences Register  Pick the best domain and register it Best Practices For Generating Interesting Domain Names 1. Keep The Domain Short And Easy To Spell People type the domain in the search bar if they want to go to a specific website.You have to ensure that your domain is easy to type. You want to make it easy for people to find you.  Short domains are usually better since they are easier to remember.  2. Keep It Simple Think about what the domain sounds like spoken out loud.  For example, a Halloween store might be called ‘WhichWitch.com’. It’s interesting, fun, and catchy. But you would have to constantly clarify the spelling of ‘which’ and ‘witch’. 3. Use Keywords If you’re not going for a company-based URL, i.e. ‘mycompany.com’, then you should choose something relevant to your industry. Try adding your favorite keyword in the search bar of our Domain Name Generator to get a list of good domain name suggestions. You can target keywords that are relevant to your industry. This is good for SEO.  For example, if you are working in construction, you might brainstorm around terms like ‘development, ‘architecture’, or ‘building’. Google’s Keyword Planner can help you find relevant keyword suggestions. 4. Avoid Numbers And Symbols There are a couple of reasons to avoid symbols and numbers. The biggest one is that symbols are hard to pronounce.  Let’s say you pick the custom domain ‘MyConstruction-62.com.’   Imagine saying ‘MyConstruction, hyphen, sixty-two, that’s sixty-two the number, dot com.’  It’s much easier to just say ‘MyConstruction.com’. Domains like that are also much easier to type and remember. This brings us to the last point. 5. Make It Memorable Having a memorable, unique, original domain name can massively help your brand. A memorable domain makes you easier to find online, increases your brand awareness, and will eventually lead to getting more business. Your goal is to make the domain as easy to remember as possible.  6. Check For Trademark Availability Trademark owners can sue domain name owners if they think the domain name could in some way be confused with their trademark. They can sue even if you legitimately own the domain and are using it for business purposes that don’t relate to the trademark. You should consider hiring a trademarking consultant to help you check if your selected domain can be trademarked. You can check for registered trademarks on your own. Seo Friendly Domain Name Ideas Although SEO shouldn’t be the deciding factor for your custom domain, it is a good idea to keep it in mind while choosing a name. The ending segment of your domain, called the domain extension, is one of the most important factors. Most brands go with “.com” domains. These are still the most trusted and authoritative domain extensions. But, it’s probably better to go with an alternative extension than a long .com domain.  In other words, we would select something like “Cutedogs.me” rather than “Ireallylikecutedogs.com”. You can also explore local domain extensions like “.co.uk” or “.ca” if you plan to operate within a specific country.  Let’s look at the characteristics of SEO-friendly domains. We’ll even share a few examples of SEO-friendly domains and some that break the rules.  Brandable Domain Name Ideas Brandable names don’t necessarily have a meaning. They often include a mixup of consonants and vowels that might seem random.  A made-up brand name tends to be easier to trademark. It’s also easier to find an available domain name for a made-up brand name.  Some of the biggest brands in the world use brandable domain names – “Google”, “Panera, and “Adidas”.  We recognize the names “Google”, “Panera”, and “Adidas” as something important because of the businesses behind them. But they were simply made-up brand name ideas when these brands first launched.   Brandable domain names are usually:  Short  Memorable  Smooth  Catchy  Easy to spell and pronounce  Easy to register  Easy to trademark Why Do We Have The Best Domain Name Generator On The Market?

You can choose between many different domain extensions when you register your domain. While alternative domains are gaining popularity, the .com domains still reign supreme. If you want to build a memorable brand out of your business, the .com domain is definitely the one you should go after if you can.  The good thing about .com domains is that they don’t cost more than other domain extensions. Some of the new extensions like .online, .design, .tech, and others cost a lot more than .com domains. Why Are .com Domains Difficult To Find?  Most of the good .com domains are already registered. It’s hard to find an available domain name.  This means you can only own them if you’re willing to pay the aftermarket price. And these can go very high.  Premium .com domains can cost anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to over a million dollars for the most desired domains. You can expect to pay a few thousand dollars for solid .com domain options. This is the price range where you can find easy to spell made-up English words or maybe even single-word English words as domains.  As you can see, the price for .com ranges from $10 for unregistered domains all the way up to a million dollars for most premium domains. It’s up to you to decide how much you’re willing to spend on your domain.  Domain Name Registration: The Step-By-Step Guide To begin with, you can use our domain name generator to develop a list of unique domain name suggestions.If you’re looking for a good domain name that you can use for your business, it’s a good idea to make sure that name is also available to trademark. 1. Check If Your Domain Name Is Available Before you settle on any final ideas check whether or not your domain is available. This can easily be done using our service, which allows you to simultaneously generate thousands of awesome ideas and then check their domain availability with instant domain search. The domain check widget on the results page can help you see which TLDs are taken, and which are free. This makes your domain name search a lot faster and more efficient. Our generator enables instant domain search to help you save time.  2. What If Your Domain Is Taken? In today’s day and age, finding a free domain name is getting harder and harder. There are a few ways you can get around this. First of all, if you’re not 100% set on making your business name exactly like your domain name you can get a little creative. Try making the name into a phrase by adding a prefix or suffix to it. For example, adding, ‘The” or “Try” before your name. Another option you have to solve domain availability is to use alternative domain extensions.  The last option is to search and find out who owns the domain name you want and ask them if you can buy it from them. 3. Should I Register A ‘.Com’ Domain? There are huge numbers of TLDs (Top-Level Domains) out there so why would you get a dot com domain? When you choose your domain extension, ‘.com’ is still the best for most domains. Around 75% of domains have the .com extension. It is the most familiar, and the easiest domain extension to remember. However, with all that being said, it is precisely because everyone uses a ‘.com’ extension that you might not be able to. Most of the .com domains have already been claimed, so finding one for your business could end up meaning you either have to use modifiers or pay a large amount to buy the premium .com domain. There are plenty of other domain extensions that your domain registrar offers, each with its generic meaning. Other TLDs 4. Registering A Country Specific Domain Starting any new business should be paired with simultaneously building an online presence. If you’re looking to start a business overseas, for example, you want to open a cafe or store in France, you want a domain name that feels local. You can add a location-based extension on for example, .fr, for France to make it clear this is a French site. Or you can explore interesting domain names in the local language, and choose one that is fitting for this new business venture overseas. To help you do this try using our best domain name generators which work in French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. 5. Should I Register A Domain For My Personal Name?  A personal domain name can be incredibly useful when trying to build your brand. On top of this, a personal domain is a great place to house your online resume. Sending and receiving emails from your personalized email address also shows you’re a professional. You can use a .me TLD for your personal address. If your name is hard to spell then using just your surname may be better for you than the whole name. You can also use your initials, for example, John Smith might use JSmith.me, SmithJ.me, or even JohnS.me. You also have to think about how your personal brand name email address will look. For example, if the domain is johnsmith.me, the email address would be john@johnsmith.me. Try The Best Domain Generator On The Market It’s your turn to find the best domain name for your business.

A domain name is a public website address, and it’s what you type in a browser’s URL search bar to locate any website on the internet. Domain names are actually the user-friendly version of what’s going on behind the scenes when a user makes a domain name search online. For identity purposes, every computer using the internet has an assigned IP address. Each computer on this network can communicate with other computers. An IP address is a series of unique numbers that would be very challenging to memorize. Instead of having to commit thousands of numerical codes to memory to search for websites, we use domain names. They allow us to create unique digital addresses that can be easily typed and searched. Read more on Shopify Blog: What is a domain? What is a subdomain? What is DNS?

Get smart with synonyms. Try using variations of a word you want in your domain to get more options. For example, if you want a domain that includes mechanic, also plug in closely related words like repair or automotive. Mix up word combinations. Let’s take another look at that domain for mechanics. If you can’t think of any catchy synonyms, you could still dream up a few word combinations that mean the same thing, like fix cars or auto shop. Once you register a domain, take the next step. Use your domain for a business name. Once you have a domain you love, consider using it for a business name if you don’t have one already.

These 16 domain name generators will help you find what you've been looking for all along. Jeff Cardello        Can't think of a domain? Or maybe your preferred name is already taken? We've put together a comprehensive list of a few of our favorite domain name generators to help you find that memorable URL. Coming up with a domain name for a website can be hard. With so many top-level domains already accounted for, it can be hard to find one that fits with what you want to create. First, you have to think of an original name. Then you have to figure out if your idea is open and available for you to buy. Many common domain names have been taken. But don’t let this discourage you. Business name generators and domain name search apps let you see what names are open, and can give you options that would have been hard to brainstorm on your own. 16 domain name generators to find your next domain Here’s a collection of 16 useful domain registration tools you can use to make finding a domain name a smoother process. 1. Namecheap Namecheap is both a business name generator and domain search. They offer multiple ways to search and filter results, allowing for precise control in generating domain name ideas. Beast mode gives you everything you could ever want out of a domain name search. Enter in a few keywords, choose a price range, select Transform Options for creating variations, and choose the top-level domain extensions that you want to see. The top-level domain options go even further, letting you choose domain extensions according to industry categories like business, technology, and marketing. You get a lot of control in shaping the results of your search. Namecheap seems to work better when entering in full domain names, rather than keywords, so keep that in mind when using it. Namecheap is one of the best domain name generators out there and should be one of the first places you go to in searching for a name. 2. Name Ideas Generator At first glance, Name Ideas Generator seems like a fairly basic search. But putting it into action outputs a huge list of potential names, covering a variety of domain extensions. Not only do you see if a domain name is available, but you get a useful list of variations. Switching vowels, omitting letters, backward spelling, and synonyms are among just a few of the ways that Name Ideas Generator comes up with unique name ideas. Another great feature is being able to use search engine generated keywords in coming up with names. Google, Bing, YouTube, Amazon, and other platform-specific keyword generators give you even more available domain names. With the functionality to produce a wealth of new domain name ideas, Name Ideas Generator should be at the top of your list of tools you use in your domain name search. 3. GoDaddy As far as brand recognition goes, GoDaddy may be the Coca-Cola of domain name registration. What makes them so popular is the ease of their user experience. A simple search bar at the top beckons users to find their perfect domain name. It then generates a list with available top-level domains as well as variations. If you’re just beginning your domain name search, GoDaddy offers a great starting point with a simple search and easy way to purchase. 4. Instant Domain Search Instant Domain Search is exactly as it is named. As you type, available domains materialize in real time. It’s a nice touch that gives you the instant gratification of seeing which available domains are out there. One thing that’s a slight bummer — clicking on buy doesn’t always guarantee domain availability. You are shuttled over to domain.com to make a purchase, and thankfully other available options are shown, which doesn’t make this an entirely wasted effort. Instant Domain Search works well in finding domain ideas quickly, making it a useful tool in finding a name of your own without wasting a lot of time. 5. Blog Tyrant Blog Tyrant saves you time and frustration by only giving you options of available domains. It’s a relief to not have to wade through unavailable website names, making for a less disappointing domain search experience. Are you a forward thinker wanting to get in on the booming Mars real estate market in a few centuries? Blog Tyrant produces a couple useful domain names you might be able to use: Okay — we know you probably have more realistic aspirations for your website. Blog Tyrant works fantastically whatever your area of interest by giving you plenty of options. 6. NameMesh NameMesh goes all out in giving you ways of generating domain names. From checking the availability of the most popular extensions, tweaking the letter arrangement, integrating words and suffixes, as well as other functionality, you get a huge list of potential domain names with quite a few that you’ll find useful. Looking to start a business selling kitten mittens online (after all, they do get lost all the time)? NameMesh generates a wide array of variations with more hits than misses. When looking for the perfect domain name, the more choices you have the better. NameMesh comes through with a domain generator tool that outputs an avalanche of useful domain name ideas. 7. DomainWheel We’ll say it. Many domain name generators produce a lot of junk. But what if you could harness the power of AI to find a usable domain name? DomainWheel boasts that its AI-powered search generates better options. And not that anyone would ever want to take on the endeavor of selling the Mount Everest of desserts (Baked Alaska) online — but if you do, DomainWheel generates some solid options, with buybakedalaska.org being just one of a few useful name ideas. DomainWheel separates itself from all of the other domain name generators out there with an AI-guided tool that offers smarter results. 8. Bust a Name With a host of powerful search options, Bust a Name provides multiple ways to find available domain names. The domain maker panel allows you to choose a number of parameters. Pick whether to start or end with a specific word. Choose the degree of naturalness. And set the character length. You can then pick from the list of extensions on the right that’s limited to a tidy five options of .com, .net, .org, .info, and .biz. All of these variables are laid out in an easy to understand way. Another feature we really like is the ability to save domain searches and to resume a search later. This option to save the names you found that you like ensures that none of your hard work goes to waste. 9. Shopify’s domain name generator Shopify makes it super easy to set up an ecommerce store, opening the doors to anyone in launching an online business. It’s simple to put together a website, utilize their shopping cart, process orders, and deal with inventory. But to launch an online shop, you need a domain name. They offer a domain name lookup on their website, but even if you don’t require anything beyond this from Shopify, it still proves useful. Their tool doesn’t give you variations — instead, it shows you availability across a number of different extensions. This works well if you already have a few domain names in mind. 10. Nameboy Nameboy offers a domain name generator as well as a few other apps like a business name generator, a podcast name generator, and a startup name generator. The emphasis here is on domains with .com as their extension. A number of top-level domains are sprinkled in with the search results, but you don’t get bombarded with a long list of obscure extensions. If you’re looking for dot com domains, Nameboy is the place to go. Nameboy keeps things simple with a single search box. When you need a break from those tools that offer an overwhelming amount of search options, head on over to Nameboy for a straightforward search that gives you plenty of good ideas. 11. Business Name Generator Enter in a few keywords and Business Name Generator will serve as a company name generator and show you associated domains that haven’t been taken. From the keywords you input you’ll get a list of potential business names. Clicking through shows you all of the available domains that match these names. One of the hardest parts of starting a business is finding a name that has corresponding domain names available. Business Name Generator lets you find both, all through their easy to use portal. 12. Panabee Panabee impresses with a decidedly not-boring visual identity and layout. Not only does it look good, but it’s a fantastic addition to this list of free domain generators, as it offers plenty of functionality. You’re prompted to enter a few keywords into their search box. Instead of an eye-straining long scroll of results, each available domain name gets a blue heart next to it, with a broken heart next to taken domains. It’s an effective domain name generator, with the graphics and stylization making it a fun and engaging user experience. 13. Lean Domain Search Lean Domain Search offers a stripped-down process in finding the right domain name. Just enter in a term into the search box and get a page of available dot coms. And lean it is, with results that trim away less popular domain extensions. Efficiency is the focus, with Lean Domain Search offering a minimal yet powerful way of searching. Another feature worth mentioning is that Lean Domain Search also analyzes the length of a domain name to see if it would be effective as a Twitter handle. Not many domain name generators offer a way to check for social media usernames, and this is a valuable feature for anyone who also wants to have an active presence on Twitter. 14. Zyro Zyro starts with a search bar. Here you enter in your keywords, hit the button, then get a page of available domain names. Pick the one you want, then Zyro walks you through the steps to register it. Zyro stands out with a streamlined user experience. Zyro’s purpose isn’t to generate variations on a name — it shows you what’s available. We love it for this simplicity. If you don’t mind alternate extensions like .site, .xyz, or .tech, you’ll most likely find something you can use. 15. Truic Truic’s domain name generator offers a few options, letting you input keywords and specify a region and an extension. It’s well-suited for a small business that wants a domain name that reflects their locality. It yields results that are a mix of keyword-based location names and business names that have an available URL. Those who are in the beginning stages of starting a business and building a website will find this particularly helpful.

To help with that, we have created some recommended best practices for choosing the best domain name. Let’s take a look at the best practices for choosing the right domain name. 1. Choose a Brandable Domain Name One of the questions we get asked is: when choosing a domain name, should you go for a brandable domain name or a generic one? A generic domain name is usually keyword-stuffed and unmemorable, like copywritingtweaks.com or killercopywriting.com. On the other hand, a brandable domain name helps you easily stand out from the competition. Plus, your users will find it easier to remember your website. For example, ProBlogger.com or OptinMonster.com. When you hear the name, you know there’s a trustable brand attached to it. While it’s true that including a keyword in your domain name can have a positive impact on SEO. However, stuffing your domain name with keywords in the hope of increasing your ranking can also negatively impact your SEO efforts. To avoid getting penalized, it’s in your best interest to purchase a brandable domain name and make your URLs readable, like “brandname.com/blog-topic”. 2. Make It Easy to Remember Make sure your domain name is easy to type and remember. It’s important to remove confusing items from your domain name like using odd spellings, hyphens, numbers, and other characters. A few techniques you can use to generate good domain name ideas are: 3. Choose the Right Domain Name Extension .com. is the most popular domain extension, so most people’s first assumption for your website will be [yourbrandname].com. Additionally, a .com domain is easy to type from mobile devices because most onscreen keyboards come with a .com button. If you choose a different extension, you will have to do extra work to get people to remember it. Although you can find many established websites with different extensions, we highly recommend that you choose top-level domains (TLDs) like ‘.com’ because it’s the safer bet. That being said, even if you’ve come up with a long list of domain name ideas, chances are you’ll find that your preferred .com is already taken. In that case, you can go for available domain names such as .net or .org. If they’re also not available, then you should brainstorm for new domain name ideas. A great tip here is to also check if you can get related social media usernames for your brand. 4. Make Sure You can Legally Own the Domain Name You Choose Did you know that domain names that cause confusion over similar registered trademark can be cited for trademark infringement? If your domain name conflicts with any one of the millions of existing trademarks, then you risk losing it. So, before purchasing a domain name, the rule of thumb is to double-check if it conflicts with any trademarks and make sure you can legally own the domain name you choose.  5. Go for Alternatives if Your Perfect Domain Name is Taken What if the domain name you desire is already taken? Well, it is not the end of the world. If you really want to get that domain name, then check whether it’s in use. If there’s no website or the domain name is parked, then chances are the owner has an intention to sell it later on.  Look for the contact information of the owner on that parked website. If that’s not available, then you can conduct a WHOIS search to get the owner’s email address. Once you get the email address, you’ll need to negotiate with the owner to purchase the domain name.  Of course, purchasing a parked domain name is going to be costly. If you think that you can’t afford a parked domain, then the last thing you should do is misspell the name.  Think of Fiverr.com, Flickr.com, Tumblr.com. These are some successful domain names that are misspelled.  Why Use a Domain Name Generator? Choosing the perfect domain name is a tedious and time-consuming process. You’ll need to come up with a list of names and then check if they’re actually available one-by-one until you find a match. And if you don’t, chances are you’ll end up choosing a mediocre domain name for your website that fails to make a positive first impression. This is where a domain name generator comes in. A domain name generator helps you save time by automatically generating a lot of domain name ideas for your brand. All you need to do is specify your idea by submitting one or two keywords. You’ll get dozens of available ideas instantly.

They’ll also ask for the extension(s) you prefer. For example, if your business is about diabetes, you may choose diabetes products. The search will tell you if that name is available for each of the most common endings such as .com, .net, .org, or maybe an ending that’s specific to your country. If your chosen name is available, you may not need to go further. If it’s unavailable, you’ll need to alter the search parameters. There’s not a lot of thought that’s needed with this process but that may be a bad or a good thing. If you want extra options to help you find a name that’s more descriptive or more suitable than you can think of at the time or you simply want more options to choose from, then forget these basic sites and check out the following domain name generating sites (listed in no particular order) and grab the best possible domain name you can find.

These top domain name generators can really help you with creativity and help you find something that will fit your brand. Keep in mind that many of today’s top websites, businesses and brands started out with very uncommon words that were used for domain names. Have fun with the process and take your time.

While domain name generators can help with the brainstorming process and offer plenty of domain name suggestions, the final decision is entirely yours. Here are a few tips for picking the right domain name: Conclusion Picking the right domain name for your website is the building block for creating a successful online presence. Hence, your domain name needs to be meaningful and easy to remember. Domain name generators help you come up with a suitable name and check the domain name availability. All you have to do is enter the keywords, and it will check the name’s availability and offer suggestions if the preferred one is already taken. We recommend buying the domain name as soon as you find an available one before someone else gets an opportunity to take it instead. The competition for great domain names can be fierce. You may have to pay a premium price to acquire an already registered domain name. Domain Name Generators: Frequently Asked Questions How Can I Get a Free Domain Name? Some web hosting providers offer a free domain name in their plans. If you’re interested in building a website, sign up for such a plan and get a free domain name. At Hostinger, we offer a free domain name for one year on select plans. What Is the Best Domain Extension? .com is the most trusted domain extension available. When people try to remember a web address, they are more likely to assume it ends with .com. For commercial websites, the .com extension may also indicate worldwide availability. What Are Some Common Alternatives to a .com Domain Extension? Alternatives to the .com extension will depend on your website. For a regional website, consider using a ccTLD like .us or .de. As for an online business, consider using .biz or .shop. How to Find a Great Domain Name Using a Domain Name Generator? Type in a few keywords into the domain name search tool. Your brand name, relevant industry, or business location may help generate better domain ideas. Narrow down the results using filter features, such as selecting certain domain name extensions. Does It Matter Where I Buy My Domain Name? It doesn’t matter where you buy the domain name as long as you choose a reliable provider. However, each domain registrar may offer a different price for the same domain. How Do I Create a Catchy Domain Name? Ensure that the domain name is short and easy to spell. We recommend including your brand name or a keyword relevant to your website’s type of content. Should My Domain Name Be the Same as My Business Name? Yes. If the exact name has been taken, make it as close to it as possible. An entirely different name may confuse people looking for your business website. What Should I Consider When Picking a Domain Name? Think of how relevant the name is to your business operation. Also, consider using a country-code top-level domain if you’re operating regionally. Lastly, remember that popular domain extensions and certain TLDs are generally more expensive. How Do I Get a Domain Name That Is Taken but Not Used? Find the domain owner by checking the domain’s WHOIS information. Contact the owner, explain why you want to use the domain, and ask if they are willing to sell it. Was this tutorial helpful?

Done!   Results: Scratchbox Check One Name:  8 Domain Name Generators [Hand tested with screenshots] There are many Domain name generators in the market. I have shortlisted the Best Domain Name Generators here. And I have tried all to show which worked best for me (and will hopefully for you). My Testing Approach: I judged each tool based on following criteria: If you haven’t got a domain name yet, check below options to get one: I start with the one having coolest interface of all: 1. Namecheap.com Namecheap offers a domain name generator when you try on the “Beast Mode” in Domain search. You can enter upto 5000 domains or keywords and it will generate domain names along with domain availability. It also does some really cool things like: Domain Hack – Hireme.com → Hire.meDrop Last Vowel – flicker.com → flickr.comPluralize Nouns – Cooltoy.com → Cooltoys.com You can even append suffix and prefix to come up with new domain names.Once you are done getting domain from namecheap, you can also get web hosting from them. What’s more, if you happen to register a .website domain, you can get it FREE for the first year. 2. Panabee.com Panabee works best if you give two words to come up with suggestions. And sure enough, I gave my favorite two words:  “Hosting Pill” to see the combinations. It creates some of the most interesting combinations by “dropping first letter”,  “merging vowels”, “spell backwards”, etc. This is usually what those costly brand consultants do when they try to come up with a name.  It searched more than 500 Top Level Domains (TLD) to check availability. And that included Country Extension search (.us, .in, .uk, etc.) & Topic Extension Search (.bike, .church, etc.) Complete list of TLDs it searched is here Probably the most unique feature of all the domain generators I have seen – the ability to search App stores (Apple, Google) for apps with similar names. BUT, the feature was not working when I checked it (4th May 2018) – twice. 3. DomainWheel.com DomainWheel is created by developers of Themeisle.comWith DomainWheel I searched for the term “blogger” and it showed me around 16 domain ideas While the results were not that impressive, what I really liked was something which was below this tableIt helped me find words which sounded like “blogger” or which rhymed like “blogger”. This can help in creating some unique brand names. 4. FlameDomain.com FlameDomain searches for domain name from around 300+ TLDs.It has these categories on the left side based on which you can sort the generated domain names. 5. InstantDomainSearch.com I was really impressed by the time it took to search domains on InstantDomainSearch. It was INSTANT just like their name – “InstantDomainSearch”. I searched for the term “Blogger” but it was not available. So I changed it to “blogger666” and it showed available. What I really like was the options you get when you are searching for any domain. See below popup. It appears when you click on the Green circle. You have the option to visit the site, appraise the domain name, search in google, find out how that site looked using archive.org. It also showed me if there are FB, Twitter and Pinterest names available for this word. I like it. 6. Domain Name Generators: Iwantmyname.com Iwantmyname’s interface is quite simple and straightforward. I tried to search for the words “Blogger Design” as shown below:And it did throw some interesting options. The search results came fast.It also searched in Internationalized Domain Names (IDN), which is something I have not seen in any other domain name generators.Once you select a domain and add it to the cart, it checks out from their site. They don’t seem to direct to popular domain registrars. 7. Domain Name Generators: Namestall.com Namestall have different types of domain name generator tools, including: For the scope of this article, I will just review the Domain Name Generator Tool. I searched for the word “blogger” in it and it showed me the results as given below:Good thing about Namestall is – not only did it offer me options to register domain, it also gave me the option to register domain + hosting – that was really nice and convenient. 8. Domain Name Generators: Nameboy.com  Even with such a cool name, Nameboy still has a primitive web interface. I did my search by entering “Blogger” and “design” on the home page with “Rhyme” checkbox done. And this is what it showed me:I did like the grid that was presented. It neatly showed what was available in a simple, yet effective way. However, I could not see any effect on the  “Rhyme” check box on my result. And clicking on any of the “Buy” links took me directly to Godaddy. Apart from these, I did check out following domain name generators: But I did not feel any of the above were worth writing for. But if you are just starting, then instead of spending money, you can brainstorm it at Panabee or InstantDomainSearch. And if you happen to discover some good domain name generators, which I didn’t cover, please mention them below. To learn more about Domain Names, read The Story of Domain Names.

You’ll see domain availability for every suggested name, and if you find an available name you like, you can register the domain through Namecheap. 13. iwantmyname <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/iwantmyname-domain-name-generator.png"  width="645" height="715" alt="iwantmyname Domain Name Generator" /> Just want to see if your ideal domain name is available? iwantmyname is a user-friendly search tool does exactly that without all the extras. If your preferred option happens to be taken, it’ll price a number of relevant alternatives for you. However, unlike Domain Name Search, there is no option to get in contact with the registrant should you wish to purchase the domain off them. 14. DomainWheel <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domain-wheel-domain-name-generator.png"  width="830" height="609" alt="Domain Wheel Domain Name Generator" /> Newcomer DomainWheel is quickly becoming a hit on the domain generation scene for its attractive and easy-to-use interface as well as advanced functionality. The platform incorporates the top 15 extensions, including .com, .org, .net, .info, and .biz. Advanced features include SEO-oriented keyword suggestions, unlimited-keyword domains, business name generation, and a funky word combination feature that includes catchy rhymes in case you are looking for something a bit more original. 15. Dot-o-mator <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dotomator-domain-name-generator.png"  width="822" height="715" alt="Dot-o-mator Domain Name Generator" /> Another beneficial resource for brainstorming both business and domain names, Dot-o-mator is specially designed to be used by those starting from scratch. Simply choose an appropriate category in the beginning and end box, or add your favorite keyword in either of the two. Upon clicking Combine, the tool will display a long list of .com domains, the best of which you can save in the Scratchbox. The Web 2.0 Name Generator tool also has potential. Click Generate Name! to see a random startup name appear on the screen and keep clicking until you find one you like. Once you do, use the Check Availability button to see if it’s up for sale. If you find a domain you like, you can register for it at GoDaddy or Namecheap. 16. BustAName <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bustaname-domain-name-generator.png"  width="849" height="887" alt="Bust A Name Domain Name Generator" /> BustAName is another great tool if you need help deciding on both a business and domain name. You can insert your keyword at the start or end of the domain and choose from filters such as how natural the domain should be, extensions, and the number of characters. You can find a list of alternative keywords below the suggested domain names. We suggest avoiding the Make Random Domains feature, as virtually all the results are gibberish. 17. DomainTyper <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domaintyper-domain-name-generator.png"  width="830" height="564" alt="DomainTyper Domain Name Generator" /> It’s not enough to ensure your ideal top-level domain is available: you want to make sure the name is available on your preferred social media channels as well. And that’s where DomainTyper shines. Simply type your domain into the search bar and the platform will come up with alternative suggestions and social media availability in real time. Overall, it’s a super helpful final step if you want to register multiple social media accounts that align with your domain. 18. WORDOID <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wordoid-domain-name-generator.png"  width="830" height="592" alt="Wordoid Domain Name Generator" /> Having trouble coming up with a cool new business name? WORDOID spits out a long list of made-up words for you, making it the ideal tool for the 21st-century web-based startup. It’ll even tell you which domain extensions are available and how to buy them through GoDaddy. Filters include word quality (how closely they resemble real words), length, and pattern type. Unlike other name generators on our list, WORDOID works in as many as five languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. However, it is one of the few that don’t let you type in your own words. 19. Domainr <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainr-name-generator.png"  width="394" height="770" alt="Domainr Domain Name Generator" /> Another tool that’s especially easy to use, Domainr partners with ICANN to instantly inform you whether a domain is taken and which alternative extensions are available. However, keep this mind – the platform won’t help you come up with new ideas, so  Domainr won’t be a good fit if you’re still at that stage. 20. Domain Hole <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainhole-name-generator.png"  width="870" height="430" alt="Domain Hole Domain Name Generator" /> Don’t have a keyword yet? No biggy. Domain Hole can help you brainstorm without this vital piece of information. It’s also got loads of added functionality that’s lacking in other generators. Examples include the ability to look up soon-to-expire domains as well as perform bulk domain checks, which are both super valuable functions for domain drop-catchers. Other advanced metrics include domain and page authority rankings, backlinks, and page flow. The only catch? You’ll need to go through the trouble of signing up for a free account. And if you want to take advantage of all the features, you need to sign up for a paid account, which might throw off people who are just looking for a one-off domain name. 21. Namesmith.io <img src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/namesmith.io_.png"  width="830" height="550" alt="Namesmith.io Domain Name Generator" /> Namesmith.io touts itself as a creative business name generator, and it works wonderfully for domain ideas as well. Their filters are a little more imaginative than others, with things like prefixes and suffixes, rhymes, blends, misspellings, fantasy adaptations, and portmanteaus. The platform promises to never sell your keywords or domain ideas to third parties, which makes me wonder how many of the above options do. Find Your Next Domain as Easy as 1, 2, 3 As you can see, there are loads of valuable free resources out there to help you score the perfect domain. Whether you need help brainstorming a name from scratch or just want to quickly check if your favorite option is available, it’ll be all too easy with the above 21 online tools.

Brown in Resources 5 Comments Choosing a domain name can be a daunting task. It’s sometimes easier to come up with the website idea than naming it. It can seem like the interesting and memorable names are taken. One easy solution is to use a domain name generator to find possible names based on your keywords. In this article we’ll take a look at the most popular domain name generators on the web. All are free to use. They use AI to offer suggestions. Sometimes the suggestions are good, and sometimes not so good, but they can get you started in the right direction. For advice on domain name best practices, see the article How To Find A Good Domain Name For Your New Website. 1. Shopify Business Name Generator  Shopify Business Name Generator is an easy tool to use. Type in one word that you want your domain to include and it returns thousands of available domains that include that word. The example I used added one word to my keyword and gave me 4500 choices. 2. Instant Domain Search  Instant Domain Search allows you to enter a keyword and then see dozens of domains that use that keyword. The results include suggestions, domains that are for sale with their prices and purchase info, WhoIs info, and detailed analytics for your keyword. 3. Name Mesh  Name Mesh displays results under categories such as New, SOE, Short, Common, Mix, etc., so you can see the results based on how they can be used. You can filter the results by setting the maximum length and hiding registered names. It also has a WhoIs check if your keywords are taken. It works best with 2-3 keywords. 4. SpinXO WordPress Names  SpinXO WordPress Names provides suggestions based on your answers to several questions. Type in your name, what you are like, your hobbies, things you like, important words, and important numbers. It will provide 30 names. Click on the names to see their availability or click to spin again to see a new list of names. The availability check includes user name availability for the popular social networks. 5. Lean Domain Search  Lean Domain Search is from Automattic (the makers of WordPress). Type in a keyword you want your domain name to include and you’ll see thousands of .com options. The names will be green if they’re available and red if they’re taken. Click on a registered domain to visit the website. You can star domain names that you like, which will turn them yellow, and then view only your favorites. 6. NameStation  NameStation lets you type in a keyword and select appropriate tags to help provide names that are better focused. It will list available and taken names within tabs. Filters allow you to see names that contain your keywords, alterations, plurals, your selected topics, invented names, and more. The names are given a ranking. You can even hold contests to get ideas from the community. 7. Domainr  Domainr provides options as you type each letter. The available domains will be in green with a link to purchase.

If it’s not available the heart will be red and broken, and the domain will include a link to see similar names. 9. DomainsBot  DomainsBot returns dozens of domains based on your keyword and labels them as available, make offer, or provides their price. Each has a link to purchase.

You can see if the domain is available, WhoIs, visit the site, and see its ranking information. The generated names don’t seem to relate to the keywords but it has a domain hack feature that uses your keyword combined with extensions across the globe to make your domain available. The suggestions are in green if they’re available and red if they’re not. If the domain is available it includes a link to purchase. 11. Bust a Name  Bust a Name lets you enter lots of keywords and then combines them in various ways to create domain names. You can remove the keywords or select related words, and create groups of words and keep words from being combined. You can sort the results, purchase, and save them for review later. Choose options such as selecting 2 or 3 word combinations, choosing prefixes and suffixes, adding hyphens, pluralizing, and dropping the last vowel. 12. Dot-o-mator  Dot-o-mator combines words based on what you select or type into two fields. The more words you can type into the fields the better. The results will display the number of available names along with the names, and the number of taken names with a button to view them if you want. Clicking on an available name gives you the option to purchase or add it to the scratchbox, which allows you to check availability of multiple domains at once. 13. Nameboy  Nameboy lets you enter a primary keyword, a secondary keyword, and choose to allow hyphens or rhymes. The results will display in a table that shows the name and extensions, which will be color-coded according to availability.

Using the commands, you can make it return synonyms, rhymes, numbers, parts of speech, endings, colors, phonics, and lots more. Results are listed with extensions that are color-coded according to availability. Hovering over the extensions gives you a popup with prices and links to purchase. 18. Impossibility  Impossibility lets you choose between 4, 5, and 6 letters, and between adjectives, verbs, and nouns – adding them to the beginning or end of your keyword.

You can combine names or add popular words. Final Thoughts With so few names available it can be difficult thinking up a name for your domain. A domain name generator is a great way to get a head start and can even provide names you never would have considered before and could even create a brand new word just for you. We’d like to hear from you. Have you used a domain name generator? Which is your favorite? Let us know in the comments.
