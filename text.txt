Please see our page dedicated to How to improve your broadband speed for more information about these and how to optimise your speed. For Wi-Fi speed improvements see our How to improve my wireless broadband speed page. Broadband Speed Test: How fast is fast enough? Why do you need an internet speed test? We recommend that you regularly test your internet to ensure it is meeting your current and future needs. By testing regularly you will be able to see if there is any reduction in your speed over time. This could indicate a problem with the service you receive, some problem within your property or a result of increased use of the internet during that time.You can use these tests to: How fast your broadband speed should be In general, the faster your internet speed the better but, before you pay for a higher package or swap providers, you should consider what speed is good enough for your needs. When you know what you need you should Compare Broadband Packages and see what speeds are available in your area. Please see our Choosing your provider and package page for more information about getting the right package for you. The speed you need depends on if you are streaming content, making video calls or gaming. Browsing the internet, sending emails or using social media are not demanding. A speed of 25 Mb/s is probably good enough for the average home user. The more users and/or devices using the internet the more speed is required and the type of activity also changes the requirements. Test your speed now and compare the results with the following to see if your current speed meets your needs. We work hard to ensure our broadband speed test produce the best, most accurate results possible. Speeds needed for streaming: Speeds of 0.3 (SD) to 1.5 (HD) Mb/s will be sufficient for video calls and speeds of 3 Mb/s are ideal for social media.For online gaming, you will need download speeds of more than 3 Mb/s and upload speeds of > 1 Mb/s. Latency is particularly important for many online games. Latency is a measure of how responsive your internet connection is. It has an impact on how long after you click something for you to see the corresponding change. This is why it is so important for games but it also improves any online activity. The ping test result included in our results will give a good indication of latency - the smaller the better. Get accurate tests and improve your speed It is important to understand the accuracy of each internet speed test as well as the purpose of the test. Our broadband speed test tool accurately shows the speed at a given time and under the circumstances that were present at the time of the test:- the result will be affected by any other device or application that is using the internet. If you want to measure the maximum possible speed you should ensure that the internet is not being used by other devices or applications and that the measurement is taken as close to the router as possible. You are most likely to be interested in how good your speed is in various locations in your premises, using wireless connections and when all members of the household are using the internet. If you are interested in monitoring how the speed changes with time then it is best to ensure you measure on the same device and at the same time and, where possible, with the same number of devices using the internet. If you complain to your provider they will measure the speed at the router and it is this speed that will determine if you are getting what you paid for. For this reason, we recommend taking tests as near as possible to the router and ideally when connected directly to the router with a network cable. Our speed checker includes a wifi speed test that measures your wifi speed to identify any bottlenecks. If you are interested in measuring the best available speed then you should consider the following things that affect the speed: Please see our page dedicated to How to improve your broadband speed for more information about these and how to optimise your speed. See our How to improve wifi broadband speed page for how to improve your Wi-Fi speed. See our How to complain page for a guide to submitting an effective complaint to your provider, Ofcom and/or ombudsman. About the SpeedChecker Broadband Speed Test What must be installed to use our Broadband SpeedTest tool? Our speedtest tool works in all modern browsers including the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. No other software or applications are required. How does the broadband speed check work? Our broadband speed check measures the time taken to download random data from our servers. Data is continuously downloaded until we are confident that we have an accurate result. How long does it take to check my broadband speed? Our broadband speed check normally completes in around 30 seconds. This time is required to ensure that the test is as accurate as possible. Quicker tests are not as accurate. How accurate is the speed checker? Our software analyses the performance of the test in order to ensure the results we provide are a true reflection of the user experience during the test. This is the actual speed at the time of the test and results at other times will vary depending on factors in the premises as well as other factors between the premises and the Internet. Questions Why does my speed vary? Speeds can vary during the day for a number of reasons. You can read more here: How to Improve Your Internet Speed. These reasons include: Why is my mobile speed different from my desktop/computer speed? This could be for a number of reasons, such as: Why does the internet speed test fail? This could be due to unreliable or unstable connections between the device and the internet. This is usually a temporary problem and repeating the test will be successful. We will keep trying to complete a successful test for up to 60 seconds before canceling the test. If the test still fails then please check the factors that can affect your results: How to improve your Broadband Speed.

How to use our broadband speed checker For the most accurate results, you should use a cable to connect your computer to your router before running the test. If you need to test wirelessly, position yourself as close to your router as possible. You should also make sure nothing else is using your internet connection, or running on your computer, while performing the test.  Use Which? To Switch Broadband Search now for faster, more reliable broadband services What do the broadband speed test results show? The tool measures the response time, or latency, of your broadband connection, as well as your download and upload speeds. The response time, measured in milliseconds (ms), shows how quickly you get a response after you&#x27;ve sent out a request. More responsive connections – indicated with a low number – are necessary for applications where timing is everything, such as interactive video games. The download speed shows the rate at which data is transferred from the internet to your device, while the upload speed shows the reverse – the rate that data is transferred from your device to the internet. Download speeds are usually of more interest, as most tasks require you to download information. However, if you use your connection for video calls or online gaming, keep an eye on the upload rate, too, as it&#x27;s essential for both. It&#x27;s important to note that the speed test results only represent a snapshot of your broadband connection at the time of testing. So to build an accurate picture, we would suggest you run several tests during a single week, in peak use time (between 8pm and 10pm) and during off-peak times. The results also only show the speeds you&#x27;re getting on the device you&#x27;re using for the test – the speed your provider is delivering to your home may be higher, especially if you&#x27;re performing the test wirelessly at some distance from your router. &nbsp; What you can do if your broadband speeds are slow If your speeds are significantly less than you expected, your broadband provider may be in breach of contract. We suggest calling your internet service provider (ISP) as a first step to see what it can do. Start by providing evidence of your internet speeds – it&#x27;s a good idea to keep a diary of interruptions and to regularly use the speed checker tool to build up a true picture of your service.  If your broadband contract started after March 2019 and you&#x27;re with one of the providers that has signed Ofcom’s voluntary code of practice (BT, EE, Plusnet, TalkTalk, Utility Warehouse, Virgin Media and Zen Internet), your provider must give you a minimum guaranteed speed when you take out a new contract. If your speed drops below this, your provider must improve it within a month – if it can&#x27;t, it must allow you to exit your contract penalty-free. If you&#x27;re not happy with your ISP&#x27;s response, follow our guide on how to complain about your broadband speed, and don&#x27;t forget to check our advice on how to speed up slow broadband.

Put your connection to the test, because testing options abound. Here&#039;s how to see if you&#039;re getting what you pay for. I've been writing about computers, the internet, and technology professionally for 30 years, more than half of that time with PCMag. I run several special projects including the Readers' Choice and Business Choice surveys, and yearly coverage of the Fastest ISPs and Best Gaming ISPs. I work from my home, and did it long before pandemics made it cool. Is your ISP delivering the data speeds you were promised? Is there even a way to find out? Should you just take their word for it? The answer to these questions, respectively, are "we'll see," "Yep!," and "HELL NO!" We can say that because you have access to free tools that will clock your own personal connection. Most ISPs also offer a speed test, usually a variation of something you'll see below. Skip using them. If it's your own ISP, you can't know for sure that the connection between you and the ISP servers won't be optimized for better speeds. Stick with a third-party test tool. Before you run any of these tests, be sure to: Turn off any downloads or uploads you have going on your system. That includes streaming media or live video meetings. Rebooting the system is a good start. Log out of your&nbsp;VPN software&nbsp;for the duration of the test; it adds a lot of overhead to the connection. For real accuracy, plug your PC directly into the router via Ethernet. You'll have a lot less network overhead than you would with a Wi-Fi connection. Skip testing at peak hours, like in the evening when everyone at home, or in the whole neighborhood, is streaming music or movies. Run the tests multiple times. The conditions on your internet connection can be very different at different times of day. The more data you have, the better. PCMag Speed Test We have a&nbsp;PCMag Speed Test(Opens in a new window), which you can use any time, even on a mobile device. We use the data it gathers to determine the&nbsp;Fastest ISPs&nbsp;in the US and Canada, as well as the Best Gaming ISPs. Click it below to give it a try. Ookla Speedtest Ookla Speedtest(Opens in a new window) measures the time it takes for data to transfer between your computer and a remote server by way of your local ISP connection. It determines your location and pairs you to a local Speedtest server. All you have to do is click the "Go" button. The whole process should take less than a minute to complete, and you watch it unfold in real time. Run the test a few times by clicking the "Go" button again and again&mdash;you will see fluctuations in the data speed from test to test, depending on the network congestion at any given time. The real benefit in using Speedtest.net comes with creating an account. With that, you can change settings, like picking a server for testing, and make it permanent so it's saved for every time you visit. You can view your entire test history to see how your internet connection changes over time. To put those numbers in context, click the "Results" link to compare your results to global average speeds. If you used more than one connection (say you went from a&nbsp;hotspot&nbsp;to home and ran tests in both locations on the same PC), or used more than one connection server, click "Filter Results" to narrow down which tests/servers you want to see. Use the Speedtest mobile apps to test on your smartphone (iOS,(Opens in a new window)&nbsp;Android(Opens in a new window)) which includes an integrated VPN option that costs $4.99 per month.

To compare your speeds with the rest of the world, go to the&nbsp;Speedtest Global Index(Opens in a new window), which offers average throughput for mobile and fixed broadband connections across the globe. Many ISPs run a version of Speedtest on their own servers for testing customer connections. Those tests become part of Speedtest's dataset, which is used to create the Global Index and other things. TestMy.net TestMy.net(Opens in a new window) tries to stand out from the competition by not tying its real-world broadband tests to any particular ISPs. The results are also always based on completed tests performed start to finish, not estimates, which it says other tests do regularly. It has servers in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. It's all browser based using HTML5 so the same test works on mobile browsers as well as desktop&mdash;there's no separate apps for iOS or Android. The site does have ads full of ad-traps however&mdash;lots of "Start" buttons intended to trick you into clicking the commercial rather than the speed test itself. Be careful. You can run a download-only test, upload-only test, or do automatic to check it all plus latency. There's an option to sign up for an account to get results emailed to you directly. Fast.com Netflix has a vested interest in making sure the internet used by its customers is lightning fast. So it has its very own speed test. Visit&nbsp;Fast.com(Opens in a new window)&nbsp;and you don't even have to click a button. It starts an immediate download speed test. You can click for more results, get latency and upload test results, and share data on Facebook or Twitter instantly. With Fast.com, however, you can't pick the server you test against. There is also a FAST Speed Test app for&nbsp;iOS(Opens in a new window)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Android(Opens in a new window). Recommended by Our Editors Speedof.Me Speedof.Me(Opens in a new window)&nbsp;has a zippy little test that works on mobile devices and the desktop. It offers a history at the bottom if you run multiple tests, and provides an "instant look" graph as the test runs multiple passes for download and upload. It has 100+ servers in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and a couple in Australia&mdash;it picks the fastest (vs. the closest) one for you.

A broadband speed test will take a short amount of time to complete. The speed test will allow you to: How broadband speed is measured? Broadband speed is measured in kilobits per second (Kbps) and megabits per second (Mbps). The higher the number of bits you're able to download per second, the faster the connection. There are two checks used that contribute to your overall broadband speed - download speed and upload speed. Download speed: This is the speed at which information is transferred from the internet to your computer. Having a faster download speed will result in a smoother and speedier experience if for instance your watching films and TV shows. Upload speed: The speed at which information is transferred from your computer or other devices to the internet. It also includes how quickly you can post photos on social media, send emails and many other activities.  Statistics are taken from Ofcom based on November 2018 In May 2019, Ofcom reported that 'the average actual home broadband download speed in 2018 was 50Mbit/s for the first time', which is an increase of 18% from previous years. Users want faster speeds, and availability is now better than ever. If you're experiencing consistently low speeds, talk to your provider about faster broadband packages or alternatively, move provider altogether. How to get the most accurate results What to do if your broadband speed is slow If your speed test returns and results that are slower than your provider advertised, see if you can boost your broadband speed on your own. However, if you’ve done all you can and your speed is consistently slow, speak to your broadband provider. What affects broadband speed?  Distance from the exchange Your distance from the exchange will affect the speed of ASDL broadband. It’ll be worth switching to Fibre if your speeds are slow and you’re willing to pay a bit more. Number of connections in your home The speed of your service will depend on how many people are using your internet connection at any one time. If your household has multiple users on desktops, laptops, mobile phones and tablets, your speed will be slower. Time of day Download speeds slow down during peak internet times, usually between 18:00 and 23:00 GMT. Weather Rain, wind and extreme weather conditions can affect both your speed and connection. Quality of cables/modem If you have an older modem or wires, there may be a limit on what speed of upload you can receive.&nbsp; When you update your broadband or switch suppliers, many providers will update your hardware as part of their package. If they don't do this as standard, it may be worthwhile asking. Viruses/Spyware/adware These will not just slow down your internet but your browsing device in general and may compromise your online security. Is it worth switching providers? If you want faster speeds you can shop around for a different provider by comparing broadband offers. If you're currently on an ADSL line then moving to Fibre Optic will give you a faster and more reliable connection. Check out our guide to switching provider for more information.&nbsp; If you're not happy with your current broadband provider, use our comparison tool to find the right deal for you - but remember the price isn’t everything. The right broadband package must have the speed you want and accommodate the amount of data you and your family need to use the internet. If your household uses a lot of data then a faster speed is likely to benefit everyone.

All Rights Reserved Speed Test Why should I test my internet speed with an internet speed test? An internet speed test measures the connection speed and quality of your connected device to the internet. It does so by running multiple consecutive tests that analyze different aspects of your internet connection, namely ping (latency), download speed, and upload speed. Each of these values represents the connection's specific qualities, which you can read more about in the paragraph after the next. This should give you a clue on how to understand the final speed test results. But before we get to these, we first want to discuss how to perform each test. WiFi Speed Test Online Test my internet speed? How to test download speed? To speed test internet performance for downloading data the test is performed by opening multiple connections to a server and simultaneously starting the download of a large data file on all connections. This approach ensures that the entire bandwidth of the internet connection is maxed out, and thereby the maximum data throughput can be measured. Recording the data throughput against measurement time finally yields the available internet speed for downloading data. How to test upload speed? Upload speed is tested by reversing the sequence of the download analysis. Again multiple connections are opened to the test server. Instead of downloading a file, a large file of random data is created on your device and pushed through all connections to the server. Pushing the data to the server over the network via multiple streams ensures that the maximum throughput is measured. Again, recording the data throughput against time yields the available internet speed for uploading data. How to test ping? During the ping test, the device sends a small data package over the network to the test server on the internet. This test doesn't focus on upload speeds but on response time. When the server receives this package, it will send it back to the device, completing the roundtrip. The time it takes the data package to complete the roundtrip is called latency, also known as ping. To achieve an accurate reading, multiple ping tests are conducted consecutively, with the final result being the average of all these tests. All these are automatically handled for you when you use Speedcheck to test internet speed. But you should take one crucial aspect into account to test speed accurately. Choose the right tool. This depends on the device you want to use, being a phone or tablet, or a computer. To check internet speed on a computer, use your browser and the app on this website. To achieve accurate results on mobile devices, you should download our iOS or Android app, respectively. This is especially important when running a WiFi speed test. Because browsers on mobile devices have poor performance, we suggest using a mobile app written in native code to ensure the most accurate speed test results. Internet Speed Metrics What is download speed? Download speed determines the transfer rate of how fast data is transferred to your device from the internet. It's calculated by dividing the total throughput of data in a given time frame by its duration. Therefore its unit is denoted by units of data over time. Most often, download speeds are denoted in Megabits per second (Mbps or Mb/s), although other forms like Kilobits per second (Kbps or Kb/s) or Megabyte per second (MBps or MB/s) are also common. What is upload speed? Upload speeds as opposed to download speeds characterize the amount of data your device can send to the internet. It's calculated the same way and is therefore denoted in the same units. Upload speed is very important for online gaming and video calls, where you need as much speed as possible. What is a ping (latency)? The ping or latency describes the delay of a signal due to the time it takes that signal to travel to its destination. In this context, it represents the time it takes a data package to complete its roundtrip over the network and the acknowledgment from the server that it was received. As a value of time, it is denoted as such, most often in Milliseconds (ms). It's a value for the responsiveness of your connection that also correlates with packet loss. A high latency will lead to more packet loss while a low latency will ensure almost none. Why should I test my internet? I can test my internet speed to learn about my connection speeds. This enables me to a) ensure that I'm getting what I'm paying for from my internet service provider and b) helps me adapt my expectations about what type of applications I can run like online games or video calls without issues on my network. How fast is your internet? It's important to understand that different internet speeds are necessary for different usage scenarios. Both download and upload speeds determine what's possible. So when you test internet speed, keep in mind that the question "How fast is my internet?" can only be answered in relation to what you want to use the connection for. While simply browsing the web can be achieved with low single-digit megabit per second speeds, streaming Netflix in 4K resolution will need a maximum speed of at least a 25Mbps connection speed. Online gaming will primarily be influenced by your ping, with a smaller ping being better while publishing content on the web, like uploading large videos to Youtube will be primarily constrained by your upload bandwidth. To download files especially large files at a good speed you should aim for a download speed with a transfer rate of at least 10Mbps. What is the best internet speed test? We've tested and reviewed all available internet speed tests in the market and examined how well they perform on both download and upload tests.

How to test your internet speed for free If you want to check whether you&rsquo;re getting the broadband speed that your provider claims to offer, or you&rsquo;re trying to find out whether it&rsquo;s a poor Wi-FI connection causing videos to buffer or games to lag, we know a number of free ways to do it. Often it can be hard to know if it&rsquo;s your home Wi-Fi or your broadband that&rsquo;s slow. Plus, doing a &lsquo;Wi-Fi speed test&rsquo; is not the same as checking your broadband speed but there are plenty of apps (and people) which use the two terms interchangeably.&nbsp; If you try and test your internet speed over a weak or slow Wi-Fi connection, you might not get a true figure as a low Wi-Fi speed can be the bottleneck. This is actually a test of the whole connection from your device &ndash; a PC, laptop, phone or tablet &ndash; to a server on the internet. So it is testing both your Wi-Fi speed and broadband speed. Of course, you can test your mobile data speed if you run the test on your phone with Wi-Fi disabled. But what if you want to know for sure how fast your broadband connection is at your router? Well, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place as we&rsquo;ll explain everything you need to know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worth knowing that internet speeds vary depending on many factors. Sometimes, when you and all your housemates, family members or even neighbours are streaming Netflix at the same time, things can slow to a crawl. Or, it could be that a dodgy Wi-Fi connection is running slowly and making you think your broadband provider is at fault. If you use a VPN, that could be the cause of web pages loading slowly. Be sure to disable any VPN before you run tests &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re testing your VPN provider&rsquo;s speed, of course. Free internet speed test The service we use to check broadband speeds is Speedtest.net. You can do this in a web browser, or download the app for Android and iOS. It will tell you &ndash; normally within a minute &ndash; how quick your connection is, but make sure you&rsquo;re standing close to your router if running the test on a device connected via Wi-Fi. To eliminate the possibility of slow Wi-Fi, it&rsquo;s best to run the test using a laptop or PC connected directly to your router with an Ethernet cable. There are many others you can use including Fast.com, broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk and broadbandgenie.co.uk. It really depends upon how fast your broadband is: the fastest broadband in the UK can deliver 1Gbps (like Virgin Media&rsquo;s Gig1 plan), which will be faster than most Wi-Fi routers can provide. But virtually all ISP-supplied routers will offer Wi-Fi that&rsquo;s faster than your broadband speed. Those that support Wi-Fi 5 should be able to handle 300-500Mbps at close range. If you want to see how fast your home Wi-Fi performs, here&rsquo;s how to test Wi-Fi speed. Also, find out whether Wi-Fi 6E is worth it. You should know that many broadband packages are asynchronous, which means they offer different speeds for uploading and downloading. Download speeds are the headline figures you hear about because they&rsquo;re often much faster. Upload speeds can be very slow &ndash; up to 90% slower than download speeds &ndash; which is why it can take ages to upload a video to YouTube, for example, when it&rsquo;s much faster to download from YouTube. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re having trouble with Zoom calls where your own video stops and starts, you should test your upload speed and remember that smart cameras that record to the cloud will be using up some of your upload bandwidth. Internet speed tests should tell you both your upload and download speeds. They should also report your &lsquo;ping&rsquo; in miliseconds, which is the latency of your connection. This is important for real-time applications such as online gaming and video calls. A lower number is better. Note:&nbsp;The download and upload speeds will be reported in Mbps, which is Megabits per second, not to be confused with Megabytes per second. To convert between the two divide a speed in Megabits per second by 8 to get the Megabytes per second figure. You can also get apps for some speed checkers, including the ever-popular Speedtest, for iOS and Android. Chris Martin / Foundry How to test your&nbsp;Wi-Fi speed If your speed result is slower than you were expecting and you ran the test over Wi-Fi, you can check your Wi-Fi speed separately to see if that&rsquo;s the issue or not. Finding an app to test Wi-Fi speed is difficult because a lot of broadband testing apps call themselves &ldquo;Wi-Fi speed test&rdquo;. However, there is an Android app called WiFi Speed Test Internet Speed&nbsp;by Zolt&aacute;n Pallagi&nbsp;which allows you to disable the internet part and just see how fast is your local Wi-Fi. It isn&rsquo;t the prettiest, but it does the job. This only tests the &lsquo;upload&rsquo; speed, which is the speed from your phone (or tablet) to your router or whatever access point you&rsquo;re connected to. Again, the speed will be limited by the slowest device &ndash; your router might be the latest model with Wi-Fi 6 support, but unless your phone also supports the same speed, the result you see will be the speed of the slowest device. Here we&rsquo;ve tested with a Huawei P30 Pro (Wi-Fi 5) connecting to a Linksys Velop tri-band mesh system. (Ignore the BT Hub SSID &ndash; this was cloned to the Velop system to avoid having to reconfigure a whole load of devices with a new Wi-Fi network.) The speed of 461Mbps is very good, and way faster than the 60Mbps download speed we get from BT. You can use this app in various places around your home to see how speeds vary in different rooms, or even in the garden. It can be very helpful in knowing where best to place your router or mesh Wi-Fi devices. What internet speed do I need for Netflix, Zoom and gaming?

They DONT force you to pay to remove ads. Obviously the developers know they have a strong and useful app, and rather than make you pay to remove ads they know that having a product that works as it should will prove the worth of purchasing other products from them. I can respect that from a consumer standpoint. As for the app: it is a very good tool to find hot/cold WiFi spots in your home (or business) check ping, upload/download speeds and monitor the overall use of bandwidth. I have two kids with xboxes, iPhones, tablets ect. So finding the optimal spot in the house to place the router for strong WiFi speeds for everyone was .. well I’ll be perfectly blunt... parents just get this app, find the hot and cold spots for signal strength. And you will stop having to listen to kids yelling at each other about lag, long load times... ect. Just load up the app. Scan in each room. Write down the speeds and in less than 10 minutes you can stop eating Tylenol, and enjoy hearing your kids yell at someone else online rather than each other.. Amazing When I originally used this, I was worried it would be constant adware and just be really annoying. But, the saving grace is that after a couple of times, they straight up ask you if you will help them (via in app purchase) and if you can’t, you still have the option to get rid of all ads. I’m honestly baffled, no other company has treated me with such dignity and respect. This is the only company I’ve ever found that lets you get rid of ads if you’d like, and because of that I fully support this company and am going to buy in app purchases. Most other companies insert tons of adware and bitcoin miners into their products, but it’s so refreshing to see a company that isn’t resorting to those low-level methods. (Especially when you think they actually have a reason to, but choose not to) Incredibly disruptive modals, terrible ux I instantly removed this application. First you have an ad, then immediately after a modal asking you to pay to remove ads, the. Then a modal pops up telling you they are not only using tons of ads, they are selling your data. Then an ad pops up about a WiFi extender. Then a modal pops up and asks you if you want to set up a WiFi extender app or service I was so annoyed at this point I dismissed it. Then a modal pops up asking you if they can use your location. Immediately after this a modal pops up asking you how you want that to work. Then an ad takes over the screen and you are finally free in the app. When you hit speed test a full page ad pops up. Then another modal pops up but I had instantly gone to delete the app and write this review. I am awe struck at the way this company has handled their application. We realize we are getting a free app at this point and ads are one thing but this is almost criminal. I won’t support this lack of oversight and abysmal ux. Just offer the paid app, that was ridiculous. App Privacy The developer, Etrality GmbH, indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

UK average broadband speeds for August 2022 Chart showing the average download speeds across tests carried out by users of the broadband.co.uk speed test in August 2022. We record hundreds of thousands of test results every month. Broadband provider is detected by IP address rather than self selection. Mobile broadband providers and those that only serve business customers are not counted towards the national average figure. Ofcom have also published average broadband speeds recorded across the UK, including individual figures for the largest providers, different types of broadband and different types of neighbourhood. These are recorded by a different method involving equipment installed in the home to record speeds during day-to-day usage. Figures are reported twice a year. The last available report gave the UK's national average broadband speed as 28.9Mb in November 2015. Why should I be testing my broadband speed? Here are 5 great reasons to be testing your broadband speed: Without broadband speed test tools there would be no way of holding your supplier to account, you just wouldn't know if you were getting the service you are paying for. Some providers "throttle" their networks at peak times which can cause broadband connections to slow, but testing your connection regularly you can find out if your supplier is doing this to you. As well as testing your broadband speed, we'll also let you know how your speeds compare to those of other broadband customers and let you know if there are faster providers in your area. How can I ensure my test is accurate? Make sure that nothing else is using your Internet connection. This includes other apps on your computer like your email client, instant messenger or browser tabs running Facebook or other constantly updating sites. It can also include online radio, background downloads and updates to your virus checker or operating system. Make sure that nothing intensive is running on your computer. If your virus checker is in the middle of a scan or you're busy copying files or converting a video, this is likely to slow down your computer and so affect how accurately the speed test can run. If possible close all other apps, browser windows and tabs and try to run the speed test alone. This is especially important if you have a slow computer or you're running the test on a tablet or mobile phone and tend to wait a long time for apps to load. Make sure that no other devices are using your network, this could include a TV box or games console in the living room or the smartphone in your pocket. If possible turn these off or turn off the wifi connection. If possible, connect by cable rather than wirelessly. Wireless networks can get slower the further away from the router you are and can suffer interference from thick walls or metal objects. If you're on a mobile device or have to use wireless, try to stay relatively close to your router, preferably within line of site, and avoid running equipment that can cause interference such as microwave ovens or unshielded flashing lights. If possible, avoid using proxies, VPNs, and 'Turbo' features, some browsers or broadband providers offer features designed to speed up your connection by processing the data that goes through your connection before you receive it. This can artificially increase your test speed or even prevent the test from completing. Our test uses the HTTP protocol over TCP port 80, if you're having trouble with the test make sure that this traffic isn't handled by a proxy or blocked by a firewall. Some Internet connected audio-video equipment or services designed to allow access to video content in other countries can also have an affect on our test results. We recommend running the test more than once to make sure there wasn't some sort of blip during your first test. We'd also recommend using another speed test such as this Broadband Speed Test to compare your results, and testing at several different times of the day and night to see how peaktime network congestion affects your service. How does the speed test work? Unlike many speed test providers, our test doesn't require Flash and will instead run on any recent web browser with JavaScript, including tablets such as the iPad, Galaxy Tab, Google Nexus or Kindle Fire. You can even test your speed on a mobile phone without installing any apps! We've tested on a range of smartphones include iPhones, Android phones like Samsung Galaxy S4, Moto G and HTC One, and recent Windows Phone devices like the Nokia Lumia 630. The test sends a small amount of data to your browser to get a rough idea of how fast your connection is and to measure latency (how quickly transfers begin), based on this figure it then sends a large amount of data and measures how quickly this is transferred. The data transferred is randomised and designed to not benefit from compression and to avoid caching, however it can be affected by proxies and 'turbo' browser features so ensure that these are switched off before you test. We send enough data to saturate your connection ensuring that even the fastest lines are accurately tested. The test is run multiple times and these figures are averaged to get the best indication of your connection's speed. For the upload portion of the test, a similar process occurs but random data is sent back to our servers. The data our test transfers is not stored on your computer. We use browser cookies to remember your last test result, your postcode and the rating you gave your provider. This is to save you time when you next visit the site, allow comparisons with your last result and to prevent too many duplicate provider ratings. Our cookie only lasts 30 days, but will be rewritten with each test. Your test results are stored on our servers to allow us to report on the average speeds of each of the providers. This helps other visitors to our site to decide which is the best broadband provider for their needs, as do any ratings you leave for your provider. Rating your provider or entering your postcode are optional, the test will work without these. However if we have your postcode then we're able to show you the estimated speeds for your line and which technologies are available in your area. This allows you to better understand your speed in context and determine whether you have a fault, or if you're just experiencing the speeds expected in your area. What does my speed actually mean? It's easy to be confused by terms like Mbps, Mb, MB and MB/s. Broadband speed is generally measured in megabits per second. This is written as 'Mbps' or just 'Mb', sometimes this is also referred to as 'meg' or 'megs'. A 'bit' is a single binary digit of data. There are 1,000,000 bits in a megabit. Most computers measure filesize in 'bytes' rather than bits. Bits tend to be abbreviated to lower case b while bytes are abbreviated to upper case B, so a MB is very different to a Mb. Megabytes per second tend to be written as 'MB/s' or 'MB/sec'. There are 8 bits to 1 byte, 1024 bytes to the kilobyte and 1024 kilobytes to the megabyte. This means that there are actually 1,048,576 bytes or 8,388,608 bits in a megabyte. File transfer speed, as reported during a download, is likely to be measured in megabytes per second rather than megabits per second, which means this is more than 8 times slower than you might expect if you thought megabits and megabytes were equivalent. In reality a 38Mb fibre broadband connection can only download a file at 4.7MB/s. However for most webpages that's immediate loading, and for the average music album download, that's approximately one track per second. You'd also be able to download the average standard definition movie in just 3.5 minutes or in 15 minutes for a HD film. Obviously on a 76Mb connection these times are roughly halved (or a little over). Why Is My Broadband Slower Than Expected? We often get asked why broadband speed checkers sometimes report download speeds slower than the maximum theoretically possible at a property. We've compiled a list of some of the causes of slow broadband connections. You can use our broadband speed test to test your speeds at any time. We suggest you try speed tests a number of times over a period before reporting issues to your providers technical support. If your broadband's slower than expected Do I need a faster connection? If you're a heavy downloader then faster speeds will certainly allow you to download more files more quickly. If you stream videos, TV shows and films over your connection then download speeds of 5Mb or over should allow high definition content without buffering. However if you live in a home with more than one Internet user, perhaps other family members or housemates, then you can quickly discover that you need several times that at times when everyone's using your connection, especially if more than one of you wants to stream video. If you currently experience regular buffering of videos and slowdowns when other people are using your connection then you'd also very likely benefit from a speed upgrade. Will switching providers actually improve my speed? If you're not currently using a cable or fibre service then switching from standard broadband to a superfast connection will most definitely produce a significant speed improvement. If you're already on cable or fibre and on a slower package, this speed reduction is likely to be artificially enforced. Switching to a package with a higher speed limit will likely see a significant increase in your speeds. On Virgin Media cable services this is likely to always be the case, as their lines are rated to be able to achieve the maximum speeds. On a fibre to the cabinet service (such as BT Infinity), your distance from the street cabinet can reduce the maximum speed that your line can support. If you're currently on a half speed up to 38Mb service and currently seeing less that 38Mb then it's unlikely that you'll be able to benefit from switching to a faster package. If you get the full 38Mb then you still may not get the full 76Mb when you upgrade but instead get a lower figure between those two, determined by your line length. If you're unsure about this, your provider will be able to give you an accurate estimate of the maximum speed your line can support. If you're only able to switch from one standard phoneline broadband service to another then speed changes are unlikely to be as significant as switching from one broadband technology to another. However if you're on a smaller budget provider then factors such as traffic management and peak time congestion may be slowing you down either due to artificial limits or the supplier's network capacity being saturated. In this case switching to a more expensive small provider with a better reputation, or switching to a larger supplier who has invested in their network capacity to allow them to advertise a 'truly unlimited' service may result in faster download speeds at peak times (i.e. evenings). However this is unlikely to be a very significant improvement, no more than increasing your evening speed to what you're currently able to achieve at off peak times like the early morning. If you're on a rural exchange with very little competition and there's only standard phone line broadband available, BT may not have upgraded your exchange from up to 8Mb ADSL Max technology to the faster up to 24Mb ADSL2+ equipment. If this is the case then LLU providers like TalkTalk or Sky may have put their own equipment into your exchange, allowing you to possibly get increases in speed of more than double. However the size of this increase will depend on line length in terms of distance from the telephone exchange. If you're currently seeing maximum speeds of 7.5Mb on ADSL Max then switching to ADSL2+ might see your speed increase to between 16 and 19Mb. But if you're a very long distance from the exchange you may see no increase, or only a small increase of 0.5 to 1Mb. Our availability checker should be able to give you some idea of the speed difference you'll likely see and your new provider must give you an accurate estimate of speeds before you sign up.

MOBILE READY No app needed. Our broadband speed checker is ready to go on any device. Running the speed test Our free to use speed test gives an accurate calculation of the speed of your internet connection at the time the test was taken. The test uses the most modern methodology rigorously tested over a number of years of development and has been shown to be accurate from low speed (sub 1 Mbps) through to high speed (over 7 Gigabites Per Second) connections. Any speed test is a "snapshot" of the speed of the internet connection at the particular time the broadband speed test is run. There are a number of interconnecting elements that will affect the result of the speed test, including the processor load on the computer, the load on your home network, the load on the local exchange, the load on your ISP and the load on the speed test Servers. To get the most accurate result it is recommended that the test is taken on a device connected by wired ethernet cable to the router. However, this is not always realistic as most people and devices connect to the router (hub) via WiFi. So if the test is being run over WiFi it is recommended that the device is in the same room as the router and the device WiFi strength indicator shows the maximum connection to the router. It is also recommended that in order for the test result not be affected by other the devices the network that it ensured that no other devices are performing high bandwidth actions such as playing games, watching BBC iPlayer or downloading data files (such as photos, movies, applications, etc). Also look out for software updates (such as Windows Update) running as these can consume a large amount of bandwidth. Differing times of the day can produce different speed test results as there may be more users of the internet via the local exchange depending on the time of day. eg late afternoon as children come home from school and start using their home internet connection. Additionally, some older computers and mobile devices may not be able to achieve the maximum possible speed of the internet connection. This can be down to older CPU's or limited network interfaces - some older generation network interfaces will be limited to 100 Mbps. What is happening during the broadband speed test? The speed test is split into two parts, download and upload. The download portion measures the speed of the connection between the speed test servers and the computer running the speed test. The connection speed is measured in Mbps - which stands for Megabits per second or millions of bits per second. The upload portion of the test measures the connection speed between the computer running the test and the speed test servers. Again the speed is measured in Mbps. For the vast majority of internet connections, the download speed will be in the region of 4 to 6 times faster than the upload speed. Check for a great broadband deal here. Why should you check your broadband speed? There are a number of reasons for checking your broadband speed, for example: How do I test my broadband speed? BroadbandUK offers a free-to-use broadband speed checker to test your internet speed in seconds. Just click ‘Start Test’ to begin. How does the internet speed test work? During the speed test appropriately sized blocks of random data are transmitted for the download phase between the speed test servers and the computer running the speed test. The reverse happens for the upload phase, the appropriately sized blocks of random data are upload between the computer running the speed test and the speed test servers. After allowing a small amount of time for the connection to "warm up" to full capacity the speed of the connection is calculated by the amount of data transmitted divided by the time taken to transmit the data, this happens separately for both the download and upload phases. This gives an accurate real-world representation of the speed of the connection at the time the test is taking place. What factors affect my broadband speed? Broadband speeds are affected by all sorts of factors such as the distance from exchange, the quality of wiring, the number of joints in the wiring, the telephone faceplate, the quality of the router and the time of day. How can I improve my broadband speed? What Internet Speeds Do I Need? This depends on your broadband connectivity needs. If you just have one or two devices for web surfing, email, social media and moderate video most broadband connections should suffice. However, if you have a few more devices than this and want to engage in multiplayer gaming or 4K streaming we would recommend 50-100 Mbps. Busy households with more than five devices who wish to share large files and do lots of things at the same time may benefit from 150Mbps+. What Internet Speed Do I Need for Netflix?

Everything you access online – from webpages to emails and videos to songs – is made up of data and broadband speed conveys the rate at which this data is transferred from the internet to your device (download speed) or from you device to the internet (upload speed). These speeds are most commonly measured in megabits-per-second (Mbps or Mb). The higher the measurement, the less time it takes to complete the transfer of data. For example, a connection with a download speed of 38Mb will download a file more than twice as fast as one with a 17Mb limit. How do broadband speed tests work? Our speed test works by timing how long it takes your connection to download a sample file from the web and then upload back to the server. It's secure, safe, and won’t store anything on your device. Are broadband speed tests accurate? Broadband speed tests provide a snapshot of your connection’s performance by determining your respective download and upload speed at the point, and time, of testing. However, you should bear in mind that speeds fluctuate throughout the day. What if my broadband speed is not as advertised? The advertised speed of your broadband package is the maximum achievable and not a guarantee, which is why it’s prefixed with ‘up to’. If you’re not satisfied with your speed and feel it’s excessively slow, you may be able to exit your contract early. However, your first port of call should be to contact your provider for more information. They will be able to test your connection for any potential problems and may be able to improve its performance. My broadband is slow, what might be wrong? 1. Your wi-fi Wi-fi offers tremendous flexibility but it may be degrading your connection’s performance. The strength of your wi-fi signal can decrease over greater distances and may have trouble penetrating the walls and ceilings of your house. If you can, try connecting your device to your router using an Ethernet cable and running the speed test again – you may be surprised by the result. Improve wi-fi performance by placing your router in a central location. It will work best in an open, elevated position such as on bookshelf or tabletop. Whatever you do, don’t hide it away in a cupboard. Our guide to boosting your broadband signal can help you improve your broadband speeds. 2. Your family and friends The internet is made for sharing, but your connection will have limits on how many people or devices it can support reliably at once. When your broadband is serving multiple people – each with varying demands such as video streaming, web browsing, online gaming and so on – it can put a strain on overall performance. Try testing your broadband speed two to three times throughout the day; you may find that its at its fastest when fewer people are online (e.g. during a weekday afternoon). Fibre broadband packages are better suited to supporting multiple connections at once without compromising on speed and overall performance than standard broadband (ADSL). 3. Your location It’s not only the distance from your router that can impede your connection’s performance, it’s also the distance from your nearest telephone exchange and (active) street distribution cabinet. These points are where all of the information you access online or upload to the internet is routed, and the further you are from them, the slower your connection may be. A quick web search will reveal where your nearest telephone exchange is located. Cable.co.uk HQ, for example, is served by the Lichfield Exchange, which happens to be at a distance of just 0.3 miles. If you’re a standard broadband (ADSL) customer, try requesting a line speed estimate from a fibre broadband provider to see how it compares to your existing speed. The technology behind fibre optic broadband means it’s faster over longer distances. 4. Your neighbours Your neighbours aren’t stealing your internet – at least not if you have a secure wi-fi password – but they are sharing the network infrastructure that’s supporting your street and area. The principle is similar to your family sharing your home internet connection, but the scale is much larger and the capabilities greater. The more people online at once on your street and in your area, the greater the demand on the network, which means speeds can fluctuate. You’re likely to notice slower speeds at peak times such as weekday evenings and at weekends. Some broadband providers place controls on network usage to limit activity that might impeded the internet access of other users. This is called traffic management and it can be a help or hindrance depending on what you get up to online (more on this next), so it’s worth looking into to see how your connection might be affected. 5. Your provider Sometimes the issue of slow broadband can be rooted at the source. It could be that your provider’s traffic management policy is interfering, in which case you may wish to familiarise yourself with it and adjust your usage accordingly, whether that’s queuing large downloads for off-peak hours or avoiding throttle-bait tasks altogether (e.g. peer-to-peer file sharing). However, it may be that remedying the situation is out of your hands, in which case you need to get on to you provider to find a solution. If you’re not happy with your broadband service, switch to another provider. Recent advances in consumer rights mean it’s never been easier to ditch your current package for one better suited to your needs, and with hundreds of options on offer, there’s no shortage of choice. Cancelling slow broadband services From October 2015, Ofcom, the UK’s communications industry regulator, is urging ISPs to commit to an updated Voluntary Code of Practice that grants customers the power to cancel their services early if their connections are unduly slow. ISPs that have expressed an intent sign up to the revised code include: Speed guarantee As part of this code of practice, providers are required to provide customers with a “minimum guaranteed access line speed”, i.e. the slowest speed that you can expect to achieve. If you consistently experience speeds that are slower than this benchmark, your provider is obligated to take the steps necessary to resolve the issue or release you from your contract without penalty; freeing you up to get a more capable connection from a different provider.

The 7 Best Internet Speed Test Sites Posted under:&nbsp;Blog, Internet and Internet Speed Test Try to imagine not having internet in the modern world. Chances are you would have difficulties communicating with loved ones, working effectively, and even paying your bills. There is a reason that the UN considers internet connection a human right. Yet, in many cases having fast internet is just as important as having an internet connection. Video calls are becoming the norm, as is streaming content that requires more bandwidth. The COVID-19 pandemic only showcased the need further, and more of us are adapting to digital life than ever before. The world is moving forward under the assumption of faster wifi, and your household better keeps up by getting a good service. Therefore, you need to get the best internet speed you were promised by your ISP and ensure no interference with your connection. There are internet speed tests that can help and many internet speed test options. Yet which one (there are countless) is the best internet speed test to use, and what are the best ways to use them? Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about the best internet speed test sites. What is an Internet Speed Test? An&nbsp;internet speed test&nbsp;measures the quality of your connected devices and the connection speed to the internet. It does this by running various consecutive tests which analyze different aspects of your internet connection, mainly&nbsp;your download speed, upload speed, and ping&nbsp;(latency). The 7 Best Internet Speed Test Sites Without further wait, here are our top choices. Please read each selection to select the best speed test sites for your needs to get the best results. Ookla's Speedtest Our top choice is speedtest.net, which happens to be one of the oldest and most popular speed tests on the market. Despite its age (or more likely in part due to it), we find that it is the best free internet speed test for most people and one you should try first. Ookla's Speedtest has practically everything you could want in a free internet speed test tool, with all of the essential information readily available and a vast list of servers across the country, ensuring an accurate reading of your wifi speed no matter where you are.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can keep records of your previous tests if you make an account. This can be particularly helpful if you want to measure changes, keep different devices in mind, or track improvements after changing plans or making changes to your setup. It allows for optimization with less effort on your end. The main downside we found with the website is that ads appear. While we understand that the website needs to support itself, the ads could potentially interfere with the measurements, depending on the nature of the ads and your connection. SpeedOf.Me If you are looking for a good measure of your connection's consistency, then speedof.me is a test you should try. They show you the final results and how consistent your connection is throughout the speed test, which is crucial if you are testing for video calls or online gaming. However, more data can mean that said data is a bit harder to interpret. You might need to spend a little more time analyzing the results, which is not ideal if you need to do a test immediately or in a hurry. The test is also different between mobile and desktop. The mobile version is a bit more accessible (without even needing to use an app), and for that reason, SpeedOf.Me can be a great choice for mobile users of all sorts. TestMy.net A comprehensive option people looking for accuracy (and everyone should be) will love, testmy.net is a wifi speed test that runs on HTML5 and is independent of any sources of bias. It focuses on function above all else, and it functions wonderfully. It can be a little harder to look at than the other testing sites, and you might have to click through a few more pages. Still, TestMy.net provides some of the most in-depth data available from a speed test and allows you to compare your results to the averages of your city, your host, and more. Like some other wifi speed test sites, you can create an account to track results over time. This, combined with the wide array of data provided, is excellent. Xfinity Speed Test Simple and easy to use, speedtest.xfinity.com is not flashy by any means, but that is precisely what some people are looking for. It is also a free internet speed test that provides you with the standard information, is reliable, and has a nice if somewhat cluttered on some devices, design to it. What's different about it is that it provides contextual information about your wifi speed, making it a helpful tool for those who might not know what all the numbers mean. For example, the speed test will provide some bullet points on what you can do with your current download speed and a few tips about making sure the test runs as accurately as possible. This makes the Xfinity Speed Test one of the most user-friendly tests for those who do not use technology too often. Xfinity provides this free internet speed test. While we consider that a point of concern, there was no bias we could detect in the test, you do not need to be a subscriber of any kind to their services, and readings were accurate compared with other wifi tests. There is no way to save tests; the screen might feel too cluttered for some, but we are generally happy with what it can provide. Speed Test by IHT internethealthtest.org is a free internet speed test and a great way to quickly get more data than you would from the other "fast" testing sites available. Yet it is not only fast and simple but a bit more versatile than the competition. You can select your host from various places, allowing you to tailor your wifi speed test. You get to see how stable the connection is over time, letting you know if consistency will be an issue. All of the basic information is there. We did not find some of the data logging features in other speed tests, but with Speed Test by IHT, you can share your results on social media (although why would you), and you can email them to yourself for record-keeping. Overall, we recommend this service to those looking for more information on how their connection would work in various situations and those looking for a secondary test to act as a point of comparison. SpeedSmart Our next recommendation is speedsmart.net, which is easy to use, based on HTML5, and accessible from various devices. They put great effort into ensuring you get the most accurate readings possible, allowing for more data to be sent and received to ensure quality results, including ping results for those who need them. If you need to access records of previous tests, then SpeedSmart has you covered (assuming none of the other options look acceptable to you), no matter what device you use. You can use an account to keep track of everything and let yourself compare the data, whether for a network or a location. There are a few extra bits of information on the testing page, and we would like to see some more servers (although this is not a dealbreaker in their case.) SpeedSmart is a strong option for people obsessed with accuracy.&nbsp; Fast.com When you first load fast.com, you will see a large and simple display of your download speed, easy to read with no confusion. If that is all you are looking for, then fast.com will allow you to get the info and get out. After a few seconds, you can also determine your ping rate, connection, and upload speed in simple terms. There isn't even a start button; it just goes. What is interesting about Fast.com is that it's owned by Netflix, which utilizes massive internet bandwidth worldwide. They are vested in knowing how much data they are using and ensuring their customers can use their service effectively. The investment makes sense for them, given the company's history of dealing with throttled connections. There are not many additional settings, which makes us hesitant to recommend it for general purposes or get the most specific readings. However, content streamers can and should come to Fast.com first as it is a free internet speed test. One last note is that while we did rank these and think some will help more people than others, everyone has different priorities. Which of these is best for you depends on what you are looking for in a wifi speed test. Think about your wifi speed needs before settling with one, or try out several (it won't cost you anything) Why Should You Test Your Internet Speed? Why should I test my internet speed? People use them for many reasons. The most common reasons you may want to use one are: There are other reasons and uses for a speed test; perhaps you already have one in mind. You could want more information about your home (or business) internet setup, what setup you will need in the future, or what internet speed best suits your family's needs.

To diagnose your slow internet or know whether you have the issue in the first place, you will need to know some of the causes.  While there are longer guides on the subject, if you have a complicated problem or need to get into the nuts and bolts of the matter, you can start by looking into each item: There are other causes, but one of the above will likely be the culprit if your speed test shows a slower speed than usual or anticipated. Be sure to check every once in a while, as new issues and causes for slow internet can come up regularly. What to Do With the Best Internet Speed Test Site Information Now that you have your findings, you might have some decisions to make. If you have tested your connection multiple times and even with a few different tests, and things are not as you would like, you should not hesitate to take one of the following actions: Conclusion Performing an occasional internet speed test free on your connection is a great way to ensure that you are getting the services you are paying for and can help you figure out the source of any interference. We hope that one of the above free internet speed test sites can help you learn what you need to and get an accurate reading. Whatever you do, we wish you the best of luck and a swift resolution to any problems. FAQ Is an internet speed test free? There are a lot of speed tests online, and the best internet speed tests are free of charge and freely available online. Some internet speed test sites are better than others, but any of the seven picks included in this article will give you quality results for free. Is 100 Mbps fast for an internet speed? 100 Mbps and over can be considered fast for an internet speed, but it largely depends on other factors, such as frequency of use, how many users you have simultaneously, and how you're using your connection. 100 Mbps will be fast for someone using the internet only for emails, but may not be enough for a household with five users who video stream at the same time, play video games, and video chat with friends, or for a commercial space. What is the Fastest Internet Provider in my Area? One of the most common questions is which provider offers the internet. You can find that out by comparing local providers on internet provider comparison sites. Why did my internet speed slow down on 5G? There are several reasons why your internet speed may have slowed down on 5G. The first reason may be that your router is too outdated, so you want to ensure you get an updated one and that you're in full range to benefit from the maximum potential of your internet connection. The other reason is that your carrier may be using low-band carrier frequencies. The upside is that they're far-reaching. The downside is that you won't get the full internet speed potential - it's comparable to the already existing 4G LTE. Another reason may be that your 5G is not at all 5G and merely a rebranded 4G LTE, which certain carriers have opted to do, albeit in a misleading way. What internet speed is required for Netflix? It can be challenging to determine exactly how much bandwidth you need. You need to know that it depends on the number of users in your household, what they use the internet for, and whether they're using it simultaneously. For Netflix, you want a streaming speed of at least 3 to 5 Mbps, depending on your desired quality. Generally, if you go for 10 Mbps, it should be enough for two users to watch Netflix at the same time, but that increases with the number of overlapping users. To figure out how much you need, you first have to determine what internet speed you currently have. The best internet speed tests can tell you your current speed, so you know how much you need to upgrade.

Jason Cipriani Contributing Writer, ZDNet Jason Cipriani is based out of beautiful Colorado and has been covering mobile technology news and reviewing the latest gadgets for the last six years. His work can also be found on sister site CNET in the How To section, as well as across several more online publications. The next time your home internet connection is struggling -- be it to load a website, a round of Warzone is lagging or Discovery Plus keeps buffering while you're binging that new series -- take a few minutes to troubleshoot. A good place to start is by checking your internet connection's speed.  Amplifying any perceived connection issues from your internet service provider is the fact that a lot of us are still working remotely, at least part of the time. Combine that with kids home for the summer, playing games and streaming videos, and your internet speed can start to falter.  The fix may be as simple as restarting your modem and router -- which should always be your first step -- or upgrading to a mesh network as a last resort. Below, we'll show you how to check your internet connection's speed and offer advice when it comes time to troubleshoot.  Conduct a speed test on your computer, phone or tablet There are plenty of apps and websites that will test the speed of your connection. Some of the more popular speed test services include Speedtest.net, Fast.com or CloudFlare. Whether you install an app or use a website, it's a good idea to run the test a few times to get a sense of your connection's performance. Each test will take under a minute to complete, offering the download and upload speed results.  According to the FCC, this is how fast of a connection you'll need based on your usage.  The Federal Communications Commission published a guideline for household broadband speeds based on the number of devices and people connected to the same network. Basic service ranges from 3Mbps to 8Mbps, and will be good enough for light usage (browsing, email, video calls, streaming HD video, etc). Medium service is classified as 12 to 25Mbps and is best for up to three users or devices in use at the same time with medium to high usage depending on the activity. Finally, advanced service is any connection speed over 25Mbps and is best suited for those with more than four users or devices using the connection at the same time for more than light usage.  Your internet connection's speed will vary based on time of day, the number of devices connected and in use, along with other factors. I suggest running multiple speed tests over the course of a day or two, tracking the results, to gauge your connection's true speed.  (For the tech savvy, you can use a Raspberry Pi to run speed tests on a set schedule and upload the results to Google Drive for you to monitor by following this handy guide.) Ideally, you'd connect your computer directly to your ISP's modem with an ethernet cable to run a speed test, but that's not always possible. But there's another option for running a speed test: use your wireless router's app.  A speed test is a quick and easy way to see if something's wrong.  Run a speed test on your wireless router Depending on the wireless router you use, it might be possible to run a speed test through its dedicated app. For example, Google's Nest Wi-Fi includes the ability to run a speed test in the app or by asking Google Assistant how fast your internet connection is.  Eero, Linksys Velop and Asus ZenWifi routers also include the same capability, although not all support asking a smart speaker to run the test. It's best to start by looking in a dedicated app.  Using your wireless router's speed test may prove to be more accurate, in theory at least, because the router is connected directly to your modem.  You don't have to rush out and buy a new router if the speed test results are lower than you expect or are paying for. However, that may end up being the case depending on how old it is. Router technology, just like any other technology, often changes and it can lead to performance issues. If your router was purchased in the last couple of years, odds are it's fine and the issue is due to something else.  There are a lot of reasons your internet may be slow.  What to do if your speed is slower than what you pay for The first thing I recommend is turning off your modem and wireless router, leaving them off for about 30 seconds, and then turning them back on. Most of the time, this fixes any speed issues for me. We have a few more tips you can try to get your network back to working as it should.  The answer isn't as easy as calling your service provider and informing them of the subpar service. It's a frustrating fact, but ISPs are allowed to throttle your connection speed. However, there are steps you can take to determine if that's the case, or if there's another issue at fault by following this guide.  You can also check your provider's app or website for an outage. The first thing I do when my Comcast connection is acting flaky is open the Xfinity My Account app and look for any service issues. When there is one, the app will give you an estimated time of restoration. Knowing that the issue isn't anything on your end means you can forgo any troubleshooting. Finally, you can call your provider to ensure your modem supports your plan's speed, or to see if there are plans or promotions that will be worth an upgrade, so you can get the speeds you need to have a stress-free day of work and play.

Multiple factors will determine if you have adequate speed. You should consider how you use the internet, the size of your household, and which activities happen at the same time. How does this internet speed test work? The internet speed test starts by identifying the network server that is closest to you. You will see the name in the lower right-hand corner of the testing window.  A &quot;packet&quot; of information is sent from your device to the server and back. The amount of time it takes for that information to make the trip is your ping. Next, the speed test downloads and uploads a packet of data over that connection. How quickly your internet can transfer that data from the network to your device and from your device back to the network determines your download and upload speed.  This speed is measured to and from the device you are using to run the test, which means the type of connection has a big impact on the result. Speed to your device may vary greatly depending on whether you have a wired or WiFi connection. Over a WiFi connection, speed to your device may vary greatly depending on how close your device is to your WiFi point, as well as any obstructions or distance in between. On the other hand, a wired (Ethernet) connection from the device straight to the modem will be about the same as the network speed to your home or building.  What is ping (latency)? Ping, also called latency, is the amount of time it takes for your network to transfer information from your computer to a remote server and back. There will always be some latency over your network, but the lower this number, the better your performance will be. Online gamers especially want to keep an eye on ping, as high latency can lead to a noticeable delay between your actions and the actions of other players.

Frequently Asked Questions  There are a number of factors that can affect the speed of your broadband. To break it down, there are two main categories we use when talking about broadband speed:  Sync speed Throughput speed Sync speed (Only applicate to Fibre broadband) This is the speed of your broadband between the cabinet and the router in your home. Sync speed can be affected by the distance from your house to the cabinet, the internal wiring of your house and if the router it connected to an telephone extension cable. Throughput speed  Throughput speed is the speed achieved between your router and the devices in your home. The speed achieved by your device is dependent on the following conditions The speed of your broadband connection The capability of your device The amount of devices in the house utilising the broadband service The signal strength of WiFi connection   If you are a Vodafone broadband customer, you can diagnose any speed issues you might be having here  If you are with another broadband supplier, we recommend switching to Vodafone to make use of our speedy, ultra-reliable broadband. Find out what deals you can get here   That depends on how many people are using the internet at the same time, and what they are using it for. Some tasks, like streaming an HD movie on Netflix, or large file downloads or uploads, are particularly bandwidth-hungry. Whereas downloading a Word doc or browsing Facebook will use up very little bandwidth. Small households with moderate internet use will be able to take advantage of our great value Superfast Broadband packages, starting at 35 Mbps (average download speed). For those with a large household running many devices at the same time, and especially houses fitted with smart devices, we recommend higher speeds – our Gigafast Broadband packages offer up to 900 Mbps average download speeds – enough to handle just about anything you can throw at it. Things to consider for large users: Gamers and triple x game downloads 4K UHD streaming across multiple devices File back up – uplink and download Large families with high usage HD video conferencing   When you click on the ‘Go’ button, the speed tester measures:  Latency Download speed Upload speed  Latency  Latency is measured by your device sending a message to a server and the server sends a reply back. This test is repeated multiple times with the lowest value determining the final result.

Enter the postcode for your current location. Results on a mobile phone or tablet may not be 100% accurate. For the most accurate results the speed test should be run on a desktop PC or laptop. FAQs What is my broadband speed? The Uswitch Broadband Speed Test is a free service that tells you your current internet speed in seconds. It can measure speeds for all types of broadband, including copper ADSL, fibre-optic, cable and mobile broadband, plus your mobile data speed if you’re out and about. We’re always updating our broadband speed checker to be as accurate as possible, but you should know that the speed test results only represent a snapshot of your broadband connection at the time of testing. Your first results should not be seen as a full measure of your broadband’s overall performance, so you might want to test it a few times at different points in the day to get a better overall reading. However, the results can come in useful if you’re complaining to your provider about your speed, thanks to Ofcom’s Voluntary Code of Practice on Broadband Speed which sets out a minimum continuous speed providers have to supply. You can also use the results to compare your broadband speed with other broadband deals that are available in your area. If you run a Wi-Fi speed test and find that your postcode can get much faster internet speeds, you might be able to improve your connection for a slightly — and very reasonably — higher monthly cost. How does the Uswitch broadband speed checker work? When you run the Uswitch internet speed test, our tool will measure your broadband speed by downloading and uploading tiny bits of data, which are then sent to our UK servers. How long it takes for those bits of data to reach our servers gives us a measure of the overall time it takes for them to be sent and then received by your device. This, therefore, allows us to accurately assess the speed of your broadband connection, but only in that particular moment. You can read more about how our internet speed test works in our technical specifications FAQ further down the page. What does my speed actually mean? Let’s suppose you’ve tested your broadband and you’ve got a speed of 40Mbps. That’s not bad. But what does that actually allow you to do? How fast can you download movies, albums or files? ‘Mbps’ stands for ‘megabits per second’ — it’s the most common measurement used for broadband speeds. It refers to how many ‘megabits’ of data can be transferred to or from your device every second. You may have heard of ‘megabytes’ (MB) before — this is the format used to describe how large a computer file or programme is. ‘Gigabytes’ (GB) and ‘Terabytes’ (TB) are other common examples. A ‘bit’ is eight times smaller than a ‘byte’. Learn more about the difference between bits and bytes with our dedicated guide. When you see an internet speed of 40Mbps, that means about 5MB (one-eighth of that) will be transferred each second. So if you were downloading an HD movie with a 1500MB (1.5GB) file size, it should finish downloading in about five minutes. If you have a much slower internet speed of 10Mbps, it would take four times as long to download at 20 minutes. However, if you have an ultrafast broadband speed of 400Mbps, it would barely take 30 seconds. Learn more about internet speeds, and find out how long it should take you to download other file types, with our broadband download speed calculator. How can I get accurate results when I check my broadband speed? To get the most accurate result when you run a speed test, you should follow these simple steps beforehand: Why is my broadband connection so slow? If you’ve disconnected and double-checked all of the things that could affect your test result, but your broadband speed still seems unusually slow, you should do a final check of your device. Ensure all cables and routers are connected properly and that your wireless passwords are correct. If nothing seems to be wrong with your device, contact your current broadband provider for advice. There may be a fault on your line, problems with your equipment, or there could be a temporary fault with the service. If your broadband provider cannot help you to resolve your slow broadband issues, it might be time to compare broadband deals from other providers. Take a look at our guide to find out why your internet might be so slow. How to complain about broadband speed If your provider isn’t meeting your minimum speed guarantee, you can complain to it directly. If you have a minimum speed guarantee, your provider has 30 days to resolve the problem or else you can switch to another one without paying any early termination fees. If you aren’t covered by Ofcom’s Voluntary Code of Practice on Broadband Speed — which protects all contracts started on or after 1 March 2019 — or if your provider hasn’t opted in, then you should still complain to your provider. After that, if they haven’t resolved the issue to your satisfaction, you can escalate the complaint with the ombudsman. Which broadband provider is fastest? The fastest broadband provider in your area depends on where you live, and which networks are available to your home. For many, Virgin Media is the UK's fastest home broadband service, thanks to its nationwide ultrafast broadband network that 52% of the country has access to. It also recently finished upgrading its entire network to gigabit speeds, allowing it to provide some of the fastest possible speeds to UK households right now. However, it might run into some competition soon. With full fibre networks rapidly growing, many homes can now access gigabit connections that offer speeds up to 1Gbps (1000Mbps). This is the fastest type of broadband available, with a nationwide coverage of roughly 28%. Learn more about gigabit broadband with our guide. How does distance affect speeds? If you’re signed up to a cheap broadband deal or a standard copper ADSL broadband service, your home’s location could dramatically affect your broadband speed. Or to be more specific, your speed is affected by how far you live from your nearest telephone exchange. This is because ADSL broadband is delivered from the telephone exchange to your home along copper wires.The further your broadband signal has to travel, the weaker the signal and the slower the service will be. Fibre-optic broadband services are less affected by your home’s location. However, that’s not to say that it’s not still a major factor in the speeds that customers can expect. Fibre is a much more efficient way of delivering broadband than copper wires, so there’s virtually no loss of signal strength or speed during this part of your broadband’s journey to your home. However, for standard fibre connections that most homes can get, a copper wire is still used to carry your broadband signal from the telephone cabinet into your property. And it’s in this part of the journey that your speed can be affected. If you’re lucky enough to be signed up to a full fibre, or ‘fibre-to-the-premises’ (FTTP) service (such as BT and Sky’s Ultrafast packages, or a bespoke provider like Hyperoptic or Gigaclear), the speed of your broadband isn’t at all affected by your home’s distance from the exchange. This is because as the phrase ‘to the premises’ suggests, FTTP broadband uses fibre-optic cables for the whole journey to your home. At no point are copper wires used. How far am I from my broadband exchange? So you can see how your home’s location may impact your broadband service, our Wi-Fi speed test shows you how far you are from your exchange when you run it. If you live in a new-build property with a new postcode, we might not have added it to our database yet. If so, we’re afraid we won’t be able to calculate how far your home is from your telephone exchange until we update our database. We’ll still show you your broadband speed and outline the full range of providers available in your area, though. So you’ll have the most important information you need to make the right buying decision. What is the Voluntary Code of Practice on Broadband Speed? Ofcom’s Voluntary Code of Practice on Broadband Speed ensures that customers get more accurate speed estimates when they sign up by holding providers accountable to delivering those speeds. When you move onto a new broadband deal, providers who have opted into the voluntary code of practice have to give you an estimated speed during peak times. This is a period when connections tend to slow down as more people are online, so it needs to provide you with a minimum speed guarantee to ensure your speed doesn’t drop to unacceptable levels. If your provider isn’t meeting your minimum speed guarantee and you complain about it, they have 30 days to fix the issue or you can leave the contract, penalty-free. Although the code of practice is voluntary, a number of major providers — including BT, Sky, Plusnet, TalkTalk and Virgin Media — have signed up. So if you have a broadband contract starting from 1 March 2019 or later, you are entitled to receive that minimum speed guarantee or else you can leave your contract and switch to a new provider. It’s worth checking your current internet speed regularly to ensure your provider is meeting this minimum speed guarantee. Why you should run an internet speed test when working from home With many of us spending a lot of our time working from home, the speed and reliability of your broadband connection is more important than ever. Running a Wi-Fi speed test will give you a much clearer idea of how much bandwidth you have and what the limitations of your connection might be. This is important for understanding what you are able to do for work, because your internet speed will affect how much work you can actually do. We’re all aware of how frustrating it can be waiting for pages to load, videos to buffer and files to download. But if you’re running into those issues while working, it can be even more stressful. So it’s important to make sure your internet won’t hold you back during the workday. For example, if your broadband speed test delivers results of 10Mbps or less, you’ll have to take more drastic measures to ration your household’s internet usage than if you had superfast speeds of 60Mbps or ultrafast speeds of 100Mbps or higher. Running regular speed checks can also give you a clearer idea of the times of day when your broadband is performing at its best and worst. This will allow you to schedule bandwidth-heavy tasks, such as video calls and downloads, for when you’re likely to have the best broadband speed. Technical specifications  Download speed test Our broadband speed checker downloads packets of data over an HTTPS connection and measures the time the transfers take, in order to work out a download speed in Mbps (megabits per second). A small initial file is downloaded in order to gauge an approximate speed of the connection. Based on this result, the speed test selects a larger file to perform the main download speed test. For example, on a slower connection the speed test might choose a payload size of 2MB, but on a faster connection it may select one of 10MB. This enables the speed test to scale and accurately measure all types of connection, from slow ADSL to very fast fibre-optic connections. Additionally, the test simultaneously requests multiple files to download at once. This causes the user's bandwidth to be saturated, which provides an accurate picture of their download speed capacity. For this reason, we suggest that users turn off wireless connectivity for any other devices, as well as not running any data-heavy programs at the time of the test, in order to receive the most accurate results for your line's speed. Upload speed test Our internet speed test submits packets of data over an HTTPS POST connection and times how long the transfers take, in order to work out an upload speed in Mbps. The test submits multiple packets at the same time. This causes the user's bandwidth to be saturated, providing an accurate picture of their upload speed capacity. What is the speed test’s capacity? The speed test has been built to test broadband download speeds up to — and above — 1000Mbps (1Gbps). It works with the UK's fastest broadband services, including Virgin Media, BT and fibre broadband products from the likes of TalkTalk and Sky.

How to test your Mac’s internet speed and quality The past two years has put new emphasis on how important an internet connection is to our daily lives. At the same time, some of us have never experienced such slowdowns and erratic performance as in these past two years, coupled with overloading our previously capable home networks. Measuring internet networking performance can help us stay efficient, keep entertained, and remain less frustrated. Several tools can help you measure or monitor your internet and network performance, and many of them are free. One is even built into macOS Monterey. Monitor versus measure, internet versus network Checking in on your network health is always complicated by your position relative to the internet. Within your network, the speed of your connection via ethernet or Wi-Fi can constrain your internet bandwidth. If you have 1Gbps ethernet throughout your home and your connection to the rest of the world is 1Gbps or less&mdash;likely still for nearly all of us&mdash;plugging in via ethernet will provide better test results about your internet connection than using Wi-Fi, which can be variable. Many network tools measure (a single snapshot) or monitor (ongoing samples) data going in and out of a single computer. This includes all data traveling within your local network and that being sent to and received from the internet. This includes macOS&rsquo;s Activity Monitor (in Applications &gt; Utilities), Peak Hour, and iStat Menus. Peak Hour has the unique ability to also sample bandwidth data from routers and broadband modems that broadcast the information (more on that in a bit). You can also pick up some information about your network connection in the system Wi-Fi menu. Some routers and broadband modems let you log in and view throughput data or run different network tests. However, to measure how much throughput you have to and from the internet&mdash;the actual real performance of your connection&mdash;you have to use a testing tool that interacts with a server somewhere else and then reports on the speed of those interactions. Such tools include Speedtest and the macOS Monterey command-line tool&nbsp;networkQuality. Monitor your connection Often your most pressing network need isn&rsquo;t how fast your connection is, but whether it&rsquo;s working at all or working well. As my household&rsquo;s resident 24/7 one-man IT team, I often hear cries of dismay all over the house when something causes our internet to stutter or fail&mdash;temporarily or for a longer period. Having a tool that runs continuously or you can launch on demand to test your current connection can help pinpoint the problem, and lead you to check your ISP&rsquo;s status page, reboot a Wi-Fi gateway, or make a call to arrange service. These tools offer varying levels of insight and help. See How to improve Wi-Fi signal and How to fix Wi-Fi on Mac. Activity Monitor macOS&rsquo;s built-in Activity Monitor has a Network tab, which has a Data chart at the bottom that starts tracking network traffic in and out of your Mac when it&rsquo;s launched. This can help you begin the journey to see if your Mac is the problem, an individual app, or the network. Activity Monitor is located in Applications &gt; Utilities. Click the Network tab, which is located in the upper right, next to the Search icon (the magnifying glass). iStat Menus With&nbsp;iStat Menus&nbsp;($11.99), you can put current network data rates in your menu bar. Click the bar and see a tiny chart of recent activity; hover over the chart and view a larger one with selectable historical data. (We recommended&nbsp;iStat Menus&nbsp;in Mac Gems recently.)  iStat Menus 6 PeakHour PeakHour (regularly $9.99; currently, $4.99) displays a chart and throughput data in your menu bar and can pull from network sources beyond your Mac. Some routers, like the TP-Link model I use, allow PeakHour to perform continuous network management queries over the local network and receive ongoing snapshots of the throughput for all data entering and leaving your network. You can also use PeakHour to set latency monitors on sites like Google&rsquo;s Public DNS, which can reveal broader Internet problems.  PeakHour Measure your internet speed You can pick one of several tools to perform an internet throughput tests. Speedtest The free&nbsp;Speedtest&nbsp;from Ookla checks latency (see below) and upstream and downstream throughput over several seconds and then averaged. The maker sells aggregated anonymized testing data to ISPs and others. Available as a Mac or iOS/iPadOS app.  Speedtest for Mac macOS Monterey&rsquo;s networkQuality The command-line networkQuality tool appeared first in Monterey and lets you run a simple command via the Terminal to test performance. The networkQuality tool produces a straightforward result if you simply enter&nbsp;networkQuality&nbsp;in Terminal and press Return. (Yes, that camel-cap&nbsp;Q&nbsp;must be uppercase.) While it&rsquo;s running, you&rsquo;ll see a line like this: current download capacity: 139.731 Mbps - current upload capacity: 154.199 Mbps When complete, the tool prints the following text (with your numbers): ==== SUMMARY ====Upload capacity: 526.274 Mbps Download capacity: 514.126 MbpsUpload flows: 16Download flows: 20Responsiveness: High (2823 RPM) RPM stands for &ldquo;round-trips per minute,&rdquo; a measure closely related to&nbsp;latency. Latency tracks how long in seconds it takes for a data packet sent by a tool to be received by a service on the other end, a response generated, and then received back by the tool. Latency of a few to a few tens of milliseconds (ms) is ideal for interactive communications and games. Closer to 100 ms and responsiveness becomes low and video calls or gameplay may stutter or become herky-jerky. RPM is another way to think about latency, as it&rsquo;s the sequential number of operations that can be performed per minute. Measuring RPM requires a longer test than that typically used for latency. Thus latency may show you the round-trip speed average over a few seconds and RPM provides a total number of data round-trips performed one after another over a minute. If your network or Internet connection has a lot of hiccups and dropped packets, RPM offers better insight than a latency snapshot. Macworld contributor Jason Snell&nbsp;created a way&nbsp;to see output from networkQuality in your menu bar with a third-party utility that lets you add items. Web-based tests Many sites offer web-based throughput testing, including Ookla&rsquo;s Speedtest,&nbsp;Fast from Netflix&nbsp;(which has an interest in helping you figure out if you can&rsquo;t stream effectively), and&nbsp;Google and Measurement Lab&nbsp;(in support of Google Stadia). Several ISPs feature speed tests, but they almost all license their technology from Ookla. You may also want to run a Ping on your Mac. See: How to Ping on a Mac. Solving network woes If you&rsquo;re having network throughput issues, you can work through a series of quick troubleshooting measures based on how you&rsquo;ve isolated the problem. Is it your Mac? Using the monitoring and measuring tools above, you may be able to isolate it. Check that you&rsquo;re connected via Wi-Fi. Use the Network preference pane to ensure you see a green dot next to your network connection. Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi to reset its state. Restart your Mac if necessary. Is it a router on your network? Try to log in to each router and view its status. Many manufacturers offer a single tool for Wi-Fi and connection gateways that lets you see network health, such as TP-Link&rsquo;s Tether and apps for configuring Amazon Eero and NetGear Orbi. Restart one or more routers if they&rsquo;re not responsive. All your devices and routers are responsive, but you can&rsquo;t reach the internet? Log into your broadband modem, if you have access, and see what it reports. If you can&rsquo;t access the modem, that may be a problem. Otherwise, use a cell connection to consult your ISP&rsquo;s status page and run through troubleshooting. Some ISPs provide a tool that lets you reset your connection via a website without having to stay on hold for an hour and answers questions that are often terribly out of date about your Mac and network devices.

Here are 10 Possible Reasons Why Written by: Paula Novo Download vs. Upload Speed Written by: Marla Milano Speed Test FAQs What is an internet speed test? An internet speed test is a definitive way to test the speed and quality of your internet connection from your current internet service provider. Once started, it takes about one minute to complete. How do I test my internet speed? Use TestMySpeed to conduct an internet test in under a minute. All you have to do is click start and our test will run diagnostics behind the scenes and provide your speed test results.  What does an internet speed test measure? When you run an internet test, you receive live stats about your connection including download speed, upload speed, and ping time. These results help gauge the performance of your internet connection and confirm whether or not the speeds you pay for actually hold up. How can I avoid ISP speed throttling? ISP throttling is when your provider intentionally slows down your connection. This may happen due to network congestion or your ISP limiting certain types of traffic, like using torrenting sites to download content. A quick WiFi speed test can confirm whether or not your provider is throttling your connection. If you wish to avoid this, start using a virtual private network (VPN). A top rated VPN can effectively hide your IP address from providers looking to slow down internet speeds while enhancing your overall internet experience. Why is my internet so slow? A number of factors can affect your internet, such as network congestion or how far you are from your WiFi router. Running a bandwidth test can help gauge how far off it is from the speeds you pay for. If you can’t solve your internet issues on your own, try reaching out to your internet provider to find a solution. Why are my speeds slower than what I pay for? Most internet providers advertise maximum speeds available, so it’s not unusual to see a difference between your actual speeds and the speeds you signed up for. If you run a network speed test and get poor marks, there are plenty of internet options available.  &copy 2022 Internet Speed Test – Check Your Speed | TestMySpeed.com. All rights reserved. Get tech's top stories in 30 seconds: Internet Speed Test Sites Test your internet speed with these free broadband speed tests If your internet connection seems slow, the first step is often to benchmark it using an internet speed test. This type of test can give you a fairly accurate indication of how much bandwidth is available to you at the current time. See How to Test Your Internet Speed for a full tutorial on testing your bandwidth and help to determine when using something&nbsp;other&nbsp;than one of these speed testers is a better idea. Internet speed tests are great for proving that you are, or are not, getting the bandwidth from your ISP that you're paying for. They can also help determine if bandwidth throttling is something your ISP is engaging in. Test your bandwidth with one or more of these free sites, and then compare that information with the high-speed plan you&#39;ve signed up for. The best test would be one between you and any given website you're using, but these should give a general idea of the kind of bandwidth you have available. See our&nbsp;5 Rules for a More Accurate Internet Speed Test for more advice. ISP Hosted Internet Speed Tests pagadesign / E&#43; / Getty Images Testing your internet speed between you and your Internet Service Provider is the best way to go if you&#39;re planning on making an argument with your ISP about your slow internet connection. While it&#39;s possible that some of the other more generic speed tests further down our list are technically more accurate, it&#39;ll be a hard case to make to your ISP that your service isn&#39;t as fast as it should be unless you can show the same with the bandwidth tests they provide. Here&#39;s more on the official internet speed test sites for a number of popular internet service providers: Are we missing the official internet speed test site for your ISP or service? Let us know the name of the ISP and the link to the bandwidth test, and we'll get it added. Service-Based Speed Tests These days, one of the primary reasons to test your internet speed is to make sure it&#39;s fast enough for streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc. At the moment, Netflix's&nbsp;Fast.com is the only major service-specific speed test available. It measures your download speed by testing your connection between your device and Netflix's servers. It's important to note that "Netflix's servers" refers to the servers they use in their content delivery system called&nbsp;Open Connect, which is a way for ISPs to more easily&nbsp;deliver Netflix content to their customers. Therefore, the results you see at Fast.com are probably pretty similar to the results you&#39;d get with a speed test directly from your ISP. This means that the Fast.com speed test is useful not only for finding out how fast of a connection you have with Netflix but also other things you do online like download files. Let us know&nbsp;if you come across any more and we'd be happy to add them here. Most tests like this one are not a good way to test your overall bandwidth and will probably not hold much weight for an argument with your ISP. However, Netflix&#39;s speed test is a bit different since the results are determined by pinging the speed you&#39;re getting from your ISP. SpeedOf.Me All things considered, SpeedOf.Me is the best non-ISP internet speed test available. The best thing about this internet speed test service is that it works via HTML5, which is built-in to your browser, instead of Java or another technology that might require a browser plugin to be installed already. On most computers, this makes SpeedOf.Me faster to load and less of a burden on system resources... and almost certainly more accurate. SpeedOf.Me utilizes 100&#43; servers around the world, and your internet speed test is run from the quickest and most reliable one at the given time. HTML5 support also means that SpeedOf.Me works well in the browsers available on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. TestMy.net Internet Speed Test TestMy.net is easy to use, provides lots of information on how it works, and uses HTML5, which means it runs well (and fast) on mobile and desktop devices. Multithreading is supported to test your internet connection speed against multiple servers at once for a single result, or you can choose just one server out of the handful that are available. The results of a speed test can be shared as a graph, image, or text. One of our favorite things about TestMy.net is all of the comparison data it provides. You&#39;re, of course, given your own download and upload speed but also how your speeds compare to the average of testers from your ISP, city, and country. Speedtest.net Internet Speed Test Speedtest.net is probably the most well-known speed test. It&#39;s fast, free, and has available to it a huge list of worldwide test locations, making for more accurate results than average. Speedtest.net also keeps a log of all the internet speed tests that you perform and creates an attractive results graphic you can share online. Mobile apps for iPhone, Android, and Windows are also available from Speedtest.net, allowing you to test your internet speed from your phone to their servers! Other Speedtest apps are available, too, like for Apple TV and Chrome. The nearest internet testing server is automatically calculated based on your IP address. Speedtest.net is operated by Ookla, a major provider of speed test technology to other internet speed test sites. See more about Ookla at the bottom of the page. Some service providers that used to provide their own speed test now do it through other sites like Speedtest.net. Viasat, Armstrong (Zoom), Wave Broadband, and Mediacom are some examples. Bandwidth Place Speed Test © BandwidthPlace, Inc. Bandwidth Place is yet another great internet speed test option with over 50 servers across the world. Like speedof.me above, Bandwidth Place works via HTML5, meaning it would be a great choice for an internet speed test from your mobile browser. Don&#39;t use Bandwidth Place as your only test, but it might be a good choice if you&#39;d like to confirm the results you&#39;re getting with a better service like SpeedOf.Me or TestMy.net. Speakeasy Speed Test Speakeasy, now called Fusion Connect, lets you test your internet speed back and forth from a short list of server locations that you can choose manually or have chosen for you automatically. This one might be to your liking if you&#39;re for some reason interested in testing your internet speed between yourself and a specific area of the US versus the closest server possible. Ookla provides the engine and servers for Speakeasy, making it very similar to Speedtest.net, but I&#39;ve included it here due to its popularity. Ookla and Internet Speed Test Sites Ookla has a kind of monopoly on internet speed testing, probably because they&#39;ve made it so easy to use their technology on other sites. If you look carefully at a lot of internet speed test sites you find in search engine results, you might notice that ubiquitous Ookla logo. Some of these speed tests, however, like some of the ISP-hosted tests above, are powered by Ookla&#39;s excellent software but use their own server as testing points. In those cases, especially when testing your internet speed against what you&#39;re paying for, those tests are better bets than Speedtest.net. Many of these Ookla-powered bandwidth tests are essentially identically, meaning you&#39;re better off sticking with Ooka&#39;s own Speedtest.net.

If you need to test wirelessly, position yourself as close to your router as possible. Make sure that nothing else is using your internet connection, or running on your computer, while performing the test. Get better broadband speeds If you have speeds of 24mbps or more, you already have superfast&nbsp;broadband (other&nbsp;websites might use different definitions of standard and superfast broadband). You could be paying more than you need to for your broadband if you haven't switched to a faster speed or changed providers after your contract period has ended. The Boost Your Broadband website, powered by Ofcom, provides advice to help you get faster, cheaper broadband.&nbsp;You could also use a comparison site to check you're getting the best deal. Ofcom gives advice on&nbsp;practical things you can do to improve your broadband speed. What your connection speed means Broadband speeds are measured in megabits per second (mbps). The higher the mbps, the speedier your online activity should be, meaning downloads complete more quickly, webpages load faster, streaming of music or videos begins more rapidly and any video calls or online games played should display smoothly. The table below gives a rough idea of how your connection speed will affect the time it takes to do tasks online: What speed you need 17mbps - Ideal for browsing and downloading 38mbps - Great for multi-user downloading and streaming 76mbps - Best for multi-user downloading and streaming Share this page Copyright © 2022 Dorset Council   Your basket Monthly payment   Change package     Change call plan Monthly payment total &pound;xx One-off payment One-off payment total &pound;xx Included with your package Summary Monthly payment  One-off payments  Just so you know...

ALL ISPs TYPES OF INTERNET ISPs BY LOCATIONS CONTENT SPEED TEST REPORTS Internet Speed Test Need to speed up your internet? Consider using a faster VPN. We see the best results with NordVPN that gives you both fast VPN connection and advanced security. What is an internet speed test? An internet speed test is an evaluation of your existing broadband parameters. A speed test works by sending a file from a speed test server and analyzing the time it takes to download the file onto your local device (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.) and then upload it back to the server. Why should I test my internet speed? Running regular internet speed tests can help you better understand your connectivity performance trends and your connection&#8217;s maximum download and upload speeds. You may be paying for an internet connection with WiFi speeds higher than you require, which is costing you money each month. Alternatively, you may be paying for WiFi speeds that are lower than you expected. Our internet speed test can reveal whether your provider is actually meeting their advertised speeds. If you run our test multiple times and still don&#8217;t see the speeds you&#8217;re paying for, contact your ISP for more help. How does your internet speed test work? The Bandwidth Place Internet Speed Test is a browser-based, HTML5 speed test that checks your connection speed without requiring any downloads. When you begin the test, our tool will upload a set of files from your computer to the fastest test server with the lowest ping. If you would like to use a different server, we also provide the option to manually select the server location. The speed test will then run in reverse, downloading your files instead. During the entire process, our speed test will measure various metrics, such as your upload speed, download speed, and ping. How to read your speed test results What is Download Speed? Download speed is the maximum amount of data your computer can receive from the internet in a single second. What is Upload Speed? Upload speed is the maximum amount of data your computer can send to the internet in a single second. What is Ping (Latency)? Although their definitions slightly vary, ping and latency are often used interchangeably. However, when used in the context of speed test results, both ping and latency are a measurement of how quickly you can get a response after you&#8217;ve sent a request over a network. Latency and slow ping rates are often affected by packet size, packet loss, and jitter. See below if you are unfamiliar with any of those terms. What is a good internet connection speed? According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), good internet speed starts at a minimum download speed of 25 Mbps to perform everyday online tasks. Depending on your personal internet habits, your download speeds will need to meet the following minimum criteria: 1-5 Mbps for email and web browsing 15-25 Mbps for streaming HD video 40-100 Mbps for streaming 4K video and light online gaming 200+ Mbps for streaming 4K video, online gaming, and downloading large files How do I test my WiFi speed? You can use our WiFi Speed Test to check your WiFi speed. First, while standing near your router, run our speed test on a mobile device or computer connected to your WiFi network. Then connect a wired desktop or laptop directly to one of the wireless gateways&#8217; Ethernet ports. Finally, rerun our speed test with the new wired connection, and compare your results to the original WiFi speed test. Glossary: Internet Speed Terms If you are not familiar with some of the terms that have been used throughout this page, use the glossary below to gain a more comprehensive look into your network connection. Packet Loss Packet loss occurs when lost packets of data don&#8217;t reach their destination after being sent across a network. This can often result in increased latency and slower network connection. Jitter Jitter occurs when there is a variation in the time between when a signal is transmitted and when it is received over a network. This is often a result of network congestion. Mbps (megabits per second) Mbps stands for “megabits per second”. Mbps is a unit of measurement used to show the speed of a network or internet connection. Megabits (Mb) are made up of 1 million bits. Bits are the smallest unit of measurement for digital data. They are represented by zeros and ones in binary code. However, because bits are so small, it is more common to use megabits (Mb). Megabits per second refers to how many megabits can be downloaded or uploaded over a network. Internet service providers (ISPs) typically use Mbps when communicating the maximum download and upload speeds of their different internet plans. How to improve your internet speeds Restart your router or modem This is often the easiest place to start. Sometimes it&#8217;s as simple as a quick reset. Unplug your modem or wireless gateway, wait 30 seconds, then turn it back on. If your wireless connection is still poor after restarting your modem, try repeating the process with your router. Finally, you might want to try turning off the WiFi on all of your connected devices. Wait a few seconds and then turn your WiFi back on. Wait for your devices to reconnect and see if your connection speeds have improved. Check your hardware Maybe your modem and/or router are obsolete? This sometimes hampers your speed. Check with your internet service provider to ensure your equipment is up to date. In most cases, they upgrade your setup for free, although a monthly charge may apply. You can also consider purchasing your own modem and router to keep your monthly cost to a minimum. Your ISP maintains a list of third-party equipment compatible with their service. Talk with them to find out what direction is best for you. Move your router to a different location Routers are affected by location. Consider placing your wireless router close to your prime television viewing area to improve the overall streaming experience. Additionally, try to keep any walls between your router and your streaming devices to a minimum. This helps you get the most out of your bandwidth even without spending extra on a high-end router. Certain appliances, most notably microwaves, interfere with your router&#8217;s signal. So make sure you place the router where a microwave won&#8217;t hamper your WiFi. Consider a range extender Depending on the layout of your home and the location of your wireless router, you may encounter difficulty keeping a strong internet signal. Range extenders offer a relatively inexpensive way to spread your wireless signal throughout your home. Expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $150 for a decent model. They typically plug directly into a wall socket, so you are able to place the unit closer to where you do your most internet activity. Change your internet service provider If all else fails and you&#8217;ve tried the tips above, there is always the option to switch your internet provider. Internet providers typically offer multiple different types of technologies used for internet access. Some are faster than others. Here is an overview of the most widely used internet types: Cable service is the most popular and successful form of high-speed internet in the U.S. The vast majority of American cities and communities offer cable TV service, and as a result, these areas typically also provide broadband service. Harness some of the fastest download speeds on the market with speeds measuring up to 100 Mbps, nearly five times faster than DSL. Fiber optic internet is a type of network connection that transfers data via fiber optic cables. Through the use of these cables, data travels longer distances and holds the signals intact throughout. Data gets transmitted using light, which accelerates internet speeds beyond what you&#8217;d expect from cable or DSL providers. Fiber optic internet is the perfect solution for heavy internet users including gamers, video streamers, and those operating out of a home office. Users in need of on-the-go high-speed internet are best served by a mobile internet service. This type of internet service is typically provided through a cellular telephone service provider&#8217;s data plan. Serving as your gateway to WiFi freedom, mobile internet service allows you to work and play virtually anywhere in the world. No matter where you are, you can count on impressive speeds and reliable connectivity. Satellite internet provides connection using three satellite dishes: one at the internet service provider&#8217;s hub, one suspended in space, and one fixed to your property. This effectively eliminates the need for in-ground cables while increasing internet accessibility in rural areas. In fact, satellite internet is often the sole option for wireless connection in most remote areas. DSL internet is generally available through ISPs wherever telephone landlines are run. DSL is lauded for its reliability, affordability, and top speed performance. Users can expect download speeds of up to 20 Mbps, which makes everything from gaming to video streaming a total breeze. { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{ "@type": "Question", "name": "What is an internet speed test?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "An internet speed test is an evaluation of your existing broadband parameters.

Whether you’re looking to test your WiFi speed to diagnose a problem or just to see if you have good download and upload speeds in general, there are several ways to go about it. This guide will show you how to test your WiFi speed from your web browser, your mobile phone, and with the Minim app. If you’re still having trouble resolving an issue, we’ll show you how to troubleshoot some of the most common problems too. Testing your WiFi speed with a web app The easiest way to test your at-home WiFi speed is through a free web app, usually provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP). On average, speed tests take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute and transfer roughly 40 MB of data or more, so keep that in mind if you have a data-based usage plan through your ISP. Here’s a list of web-based apps that provide free at-home WiFi speed testing: Testing your WiFi speed with your phone There are dozens of mobile apps available in the iOS and Android app stores. But which one is the right one for your needs? A good, broad-scope app is the Speedtest by Ookla app, available for both iPhone and Android. Like their web-based app, their mobile app can log your speed tests and track both download and upload speeds. They also offer mobile carrier coverage maps and claim to be the “only internet connection test capable of accurately measuring 5G.” Screenshot of the Google Play store taken Aug. 13. Minim users can easily test their at-home WiFi speeds using the Minim app. The Minim app can also test for the ideal speeds for movie streaming, online gaming, and much more on your home network. Watch the video below to see just how easy it is to run a WiFi speed test on the Minim app: &nbsp; How do I improve my WiFi speed? If after running the speed tests your WiFi just isn’t kicking the way you’d like it to, it might be time to diagnose the problem. Your WiFi speed test results are impacted by a variety of factors, such as the device you’re using on the network, how many devices are currently on the network, the distance between your device and the network access point, and even the time of day. With so many factors potentially affecting your WiFi speed, it’s important to try and narrow them down until finding the root of the problem.

But there’s more to internet speed than just the numbers. We’ll walk you through all the ins and outs of measuring your internet speed and what your speed means for you. Jump to: What a speed test measures | What determines internet speed? | Tips for an accurate test | What do my results mean? | Get a better internet plan Jump to: What an internet speed test measures What does Mbps mean? Let’s start with the basics. Internet speed is measured in bits (a single binary 1 or 0) per second. Internet connections can handle a lot of this data, so we usually talk about speeds in megabits per second (Mbps), which is a million bits per second. When speeds get really fast (1,000 Mbps or faster), we talk about them in gigabits per second (Gbps), which is a billion bits per second. (1,000 Mbps = 1 Gbps) Download speed Download speed, also referred to as bandwidth, measures how fast information from the internet gets to your device (for example, how fast your Netflix show loads). It’s usually measured in megabits per second (Mbps), although really fast connections are measured in gigabits per second (Gbps). Download speed is especially important for uses like watching high-quality video or downloading software. Upload speed Just as download speed refers to how fast data gets to your device, upload speed refers to how fast information on your device can be sent to some other destination on the internet (like how fast your vacation pictures post to Instagram). For most connections, upload and download speed are usually different, but when you see internet plans advertised by speed, they’re usually focusing on just the download speed. What is latency? One other important measurement for internet speed is latency, or lag. Latency is very different from bandwidth, even though both deal with the speed of your connection. Latency refers to the time it takes for a signal to be sent from your computer to your service provider and come back. High latency can lead to more buffering on streaming video, but it’s much more disruptive in activities like video chat or online gaming. Run a search below to see what other kinds of internet are available in your area. You may be able to find much faster packages than what you have now. What determines your internet speed? If there’s one thing that everyone knows about internet speed, it’s that not all connections are created equal. Most ISPs offer multiple plans with different speeds, but often these plans also use different technologies to connect you to the internet. Though some are significantly faster than others, there are also other pros and cons besides just speed. Dial-up internet is the slowest kind of internet connection and is too slow for uses like streaming video. It can’t hit broadband speeds, usually topping out around 50 kbps (only 0.05 Mbps), though depending on the service, it can be much slower. It’s usually pretty cheap, but there are much better low-cost options these days. Satellite internet uses a satellite signal to wirelessly connect to your home. Satellite can give you the broadband speeds necessary to do things like stream video, but it’s still a relatively slow and expensive option. Satellite internet speeds range from 5 Mbps to 25 Mbps. Also, since your signal has to reach a satellite in orbit, it has incredibly high latency. The upside is that you can get it almost anywhere in the US, even in remote areas. DSL, or digital subscriber line, uses existing telephone networks, but it achieves much higher speeds than dial-up, anywhere from 0.5 Mbps to 75 Mbps. It’s not much faster than satellite and its speed is affected by the distance to your ISP’s central office. Cable internet uses copper wires, just like cable TV. Cable offers incredibly fast speeds, between 25 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps), but it also has a few drawbacks. Connections are generally shared between neighbors, which means cable networks get congested during peak hours. Cable also offers much higher download speeds than upload speeds. This isn’t an issue with cable TV, since broadcasts go only one direction, but it can be a problem for some online activities on cable internet. Fiber internet connects you to the web via fiber-optic cables. Fiber is the fastest and most reliable kind of internet service, with speeds ranging from 50 Mbps to 2,000 Mbps (2 Gbps). It also has the benefit of symmetrical upload speeds. In other words, your uploads are just as fast as your downloads. By understanding what kind of internet connection you have, you should have a good idea of how fast your connection should be. The question, though, is how much speed you’re actually getting from your connection. Tips to get the most accurate speed Testing your speed is easy, but how do you get the most accurate measurement of your internet connection? Here are a few things you can do to get the most accurate results: Pause automatic downloads First, make sure you’re not downloading any large files in the background. You can check the Task Manager on Windows or the Activity Monitor on macOS to see if any programs are trying to download updates or other large files. Close or quit all apps on your computer. You might still have some background processes using the internet but nothing that would make a big impact. Get rid of freeloaders Next, make sure that no one else on your home network is using a chunk of your bandwidth. You’re not going to get very accurate results if you have people streaming Netflix in three different rooms of your house while you test. If you suspect you might have someone stealing your Wi-Fi or some other freeloaders on your network, you can also change your network password. Check for wireless router issues Many people argue that you should always plug your computer directly into your router with an Ethernet cable before you test your internet speed. While this does give you a more accurate measure of what your ISP is giving you, it doesn’t help much if you’re still getting slow speeds where you normally use your devices. We suggest that you check your internet speed where you most often use your computer. If the speed is less than what you expect, try plugging it into your router. If you get a dramatic increase in speed, it might be time to get a better router. Connection still too slow? Run a search with your zip code to find providers with speeds and performance that meet your needs. So, what do my results mean? Once you know exactly how many Mbps you’re getting over your internet connection, what do you do next? First off, you need to make sure you can interpret your results. There’s no need to make an angry call to your ISP because you’re paying for gigabit internet but only getting upload speeds of 30 Mbps. If you have a cable connection, that’s perfectly normal, and it probably still has plenty of upload speed for your needs. Interpreting download speeds The most important number from your speed test is your download speed. That’s what’s going to determine how fast files download, how many devices your network can support, and how high the quality of your video can be. If you have DSL, you should expect your speed to be a bit lower than advertised due to your distance from the central hub, but there’s also no way to improve it unless you move your whole house closer (or switch to a different type of connection). If you have cable internet and your result is low, you’re probably experiencing congestion from the other homes in your area. Try testing your speed at another time when your neighbors are less likely to be online. If you’re hitting the proper download speeds outside of peak-use times, there’s nothing wrong with your connection. That’s just how cable works. Checking your latency If you play online games or watch live video, you also want to pay attention to your latency. If your latency is down below 20 milliseconds (ms), your experience should be perfectly smooth. If your latency is above 150 ms, you’re going to have some significant issues with lag. Some lag issues can’t be fixed because that would mean changing the laws of physics. Even going at near the speed of light, it takes time for a signal to reach a server in South Korea. Other sources of lag can be dealt with. Replacing an old router can reduce latency. Connecting directly to your router via Ethernet cable instead of over Wi-Fi will make a huge difference in preventing lag. Finally, you can upgrade to a type of connection with naturally lower latency, like fiber. Diagnosing problems If you’ve done everything you can to get the most accurate speed test and your download speeds are still way below what your ISP promised, it could mean a few different things. Malware—You might have malware on your device. Network worms and other malicious software hijack part of your bandwidth, but this is often the least of your worries. Run antivirus software to check for and remove malware. Outdated hardware—You might have outdated hardware that’s incompatible with your provider’s requirements. For example, Xfinity’s gigabit services require a DOCSIS 3.1 modem. Although DOCSIS 3.0 equipment can technically get up to gigabit speeds, Xfinity doesn’t support it. ISP issues—There might be a problem with your provider’s infrastructure. Sometimes these are just network interruptions caused by your ISP upgrading part of their network or simply doing maintenance. It could also be a more serious problem that can be fixed only by your provider. If you’ve explored the other options and are still having issues, call your ISP’s customer service. Malfunctioning equipment—If your speed is lower than expected, but there are no problems with your ISP, there might be a problem with your equipment. Reset your modem and router by turning them off, waiting for a minute or two, then turning them back on. Try connecting to your router using an Ethernet cable instead of over Wi-Fi. If you’re already using a wired connection, try swapping out your Ethernet cable for a different one. You can also try running the speed test from a different device to see if you get the same results.

When you buy something do you normally trust the seller to inspect it for you? Read more &#8594;Then why would you trust your ISP to test your Internet... TestMy.net has been a trusted speed test since 2001. You'll notice the ‘TiP’ or Test in Progress data on TestMy.net download test results you'll realize that numbers can easily be altered without lying. It is common practice among other speed tests to calculate the result based on incomplete information. Speed tests showing the maximum speed or average speeds can be HIGHLY deceiving, even experienced technicians can be tricked. The fact is, if the information used to calculate the result is altered... the result is null. The final score presented to you by TestMy.net takes everything into account, from start to finish. Nothing is altered. The ‘TiP’ data is also shown so you can interpret the results the way you want. Remember, TestMy.net is a third party and has no vested interest in your test results. Your ISP can't say that. Routing Distribution TestMy.net has a network of servers. If you suspect a connection issue use “Servers” option to test against other locations. This can help diagnose whether an issue is due to Internet routing or if it has to do with your home network and/or computer itself. TestMy.net is the first and only truly accurate HTML5 &amp; PHP driven speed test online. Other online speed tests require third party applications, TMN uses only your web browser - no Flash, no Java. This makes TestMy's speed test more sensitive to browser misconfiguration and is an excellent way to highlight performance differences between browsers. Users of TMN can see all browsers are not created equally. Since early development in 1996 this speed test has never required anything more than an Internet connected web browser. Don't let other so-called "tests" fool you... TestMy.net is the original truly accurate browser based Internet speed test. Mobile Device Testing Use TestMy.net's same powerful bandwidth testing tools on Android and iOS (iPhone, iPod and iPad). Just visit TestMy.net in your devices default web browser or use TestMy.net to highlight performance differences between different mobile browsers. TMN is a great iPad and iPhone speed test because flash and other plug-ins aren't required. No app necessary, just go to TestMy.net. TestMy's graphing system and client-side code are completely HTML5 compliant so iPad users as well as other devices can experience TMN just as they would on a desktop computer. In the footer easily switch between mobile and desktop GUI both running the same powerful test core. Speed Test Flow When you request a speed test the test data is created randomly. You're not downloading or uploading any real information. This means every TestMy.net speed test is unique, making host caching of the data difficult. When your speed test starts so does a timer, precision of which is measured in ten thousandths of a second. Also, data sizes are precise to the individual byte. Once the flow of information is finished the timer is stopped and your results are calculated. Test results are calculated first with a simple equation, (size / time) and the resulting number is used to calculate all of your final results. Your result is then compared against your own previous results as well as to other connections in your area, on your host and across the Internet. At TestMy.net you're testing more than just your connection.  Because of the way TMN is designed at higher connection speeds it's a great gauge of browser and computer performance.  Its abilities to detect issues with your computer extend beyond your Internet connection.  TMN picks up on issues other speed tests are designed to not notice.  Other speed tests are usually designed with one goal in mind, achieve the fastest result.  Make the providers look good.  TestMy.net is made by a consumer for the consumer. Improper TCP settings, bad modems and even slow hard drive performance are only a few issues TestMy.net has been known to reflect when others don't. Why don't other speed tests see the same issues? Almost all other speed tests are well known to adjust results, often ignoring the exact variables you come to test. TestMy.net does not adjust anything, from start to finish - everything is calculated. TestMy.net has powerful speed test servers across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.
