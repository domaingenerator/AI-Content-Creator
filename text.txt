CodeIgniter vs Laravel: What are the differences? Developers describe CodeIgniter as "A Fully Baked PHP Framework". CodeIgniter is a proven, agile &amp; open PHP web application framework with a small footprint. It is powering the next generation of web apps. On the other hand, Laravel is detailed as "A PHP Framework For Web Artisans". Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. CodeIgniter and Laravel belong to "Frameworks (Full Stack)" category of the tech stack. "Mvc", "Easy setup" and "Open source" are the key factors why developers consider CodeIgniter; whereas "Clean architecture", "Growing community" and "Composer friendly" are the primary reasons why Laravel is favored. CodeIgniter and Laravel are both open source tools. It seems that Laravel with 53.4K GitHub stars and 16.4K forks on GitHub has more adoption than CodeIgniter with 17.4K GitHub stars and 7.72K GitHub forks. 9GAG, PedidosYa, and Swat.io are some of the popular companies that use Laravel, whereas CodeIgniter is used by Buffer, Accenture, and Ola. Laravel has a broader approval, being mentioned in 831 company stacks &amp; 773 developers stacks; compared to CodeIgniter, which is listed in 261 company stacks and 105 developer stacks. I am wondering which language would you guys suggest learning if productivity &amp; "future-proofing" is the focus? I have now 2 years of experience with React Native &amp; Firebase and 3 years of experience with Next.js and ExpressJS. As I like the idea of separating backend &amp; frontend I think as a solo developer the MVC approach will get you way further and overall I started second guessing the whole js ecosystem and its quality. What I am currently considering the most is Django, even if I am giving up major productivity I think the opportunities Python offers with AI/ML &amp; scrapping are way superior then Rails. I would like to know how much productivity would get lost by deciding on Django. Python is simple to read. Easy to use and import libraries. It is widely used in many different application domains. It is very easy to learn compared to other languages. Considering your background is in front end technology; why not try some other language that can help you become more well rounded? Besides, there are always more and more python jobs. Django is very easy to learn. If you use Django, I recommend the Django-Rest-Framework. This will save you a lot of time. But you need to understand some Python first. I think Python is as simple as: interpreted, dynamically typed language where you use lists and dictionaries a lot. What should be used Node.js or Laravel to create a course search portal having about 50K courses, where users will create a profile and enter their academic credentials, scores, language tests, fee range, subject area, etc, and the system will filter and suggest courses meeting the entry requirements and other criteria. The applicant will then shortlist courses, he should be able to compare courses, apply for courses, upload documents and fill in application details, etc. It's not a fair comparison. Laravel is a PHP web framework, Node is a web server runtime around JS. The question should be either: If it were up to me, I'd choose Laravel because I know it and can work fast in it :-) I need advice. Am currently building a real estate marketplace mobile app using Flutter for frontend. I am not sure which backend solution to use, and thinking of using Firebase, Django or Laravel for backend and MongoDB/MariaDB for the database. I want to build an API backend and then use RESTful API calls for the frontend. I think you should first choose either a database or server side programming language then you can streamline your other choices based on that, but I think if you are building a big project then going with django + firebase / mongodb would be a good choice else choose laravel + firebase. I'm working as a full stack web developer and have been given an opportunity to re-frame the whole website which is written in PHP and JavaScript. Our website is required to be fast, efficient, having good analytics, easy to maintain and rework, and subject to frequent changes. It would be handling some medium size files like resumes, video recordings, etc. So I am thinking of changing the tech stack but confused for which backend to choose for the long run. Which back-end would prove to be better in terms of learning, development, and maintenance? If it was me, then I would go with node.js because it has huge a number of packages,community,support &amp; good dev experience and learning curve is also not that steep, if coupled with express.js, its gonna be efficient and fast in serving web requests, and if we adopt good design patterns and follow best practices, I guess it will be easy to maintain it as well, and for storing resumes, video rec etc.., I would use assest management tools like cloudinary etc.., rather than storing in db, coz Its gonna be much more faster this way. Nuxt + Fastify + GraphQL + Nginx + Memcache = fast, confortable and a lot of plug-ins. Apache is realy slow :(. Nuxt is great and easy to use. Nginx, Memcache and Fastify it's very efficient. GraphQL require much more from You then REST, but give You flaxibility, order, plugin etc. We tried and don't regret . Hi all.I want to rewrite my system.I was a complete newbie 4 years ago and have developed a comprehensive business / finance web application that has been running successfully for 3 years (I am a business person and not a developer primarily although it seems I have become a developer).Front-end is written in native PHP (no framework) and jQuery with backend and where many processes run in MySQL. Hosted on Linux and also sends emails with attachments etc.The system logic is great and the business has grown and the system is creaking and needs to be modernised.I feel I would stick with MySql as DB and update / use Django / Spring or Laravel (because its php which I understand). To me, PHP feels old fashioned.I don't mind learning new things and also I want to set the system up that it can be easily migrated to Android/iOS app with SQLite.I would probably employ an experienced developer while also doing some myself.Please provide advice -- from my research it seems Spring/Java is the way to go ... not sure.Thanks PhP might be old fashionned but Laravel is really great. I've tried nodeJs backend with express, python with flask and a little bit of serverless, and quite frankly, laravel was by far the best in my opinion. It has a lot of official packages that speeds up development (from authentification to serverless deployement), it also uses Eloquent ORM that support Mysql databases. Finally it works great with VueJs for the front end development. I recommend ExpressJS or NestJS as BackEnd and React as Front-End and PostgreSQL as the database.The reason is as follows.First of all, since it is a financial system, various services will exist, and each service must be well connected and combined with each other. The organic combination of small services that work very well is the foundation of a great system.For this, it is best to use Node.js based, and I think ExpressJS or NestJS is the best choice. We recommend choosing React or Vue as the FrontEnd. PostgreSQL is currently the best performing database. These three combinations have many examples, and their superiority has been confirmed by my implementation in many projects already. If you are interested in my advice and have any questions, please feel free to contact me. On my end for me it's better to choose Laravel. It has very good documentation and easy to code. The framework supports MVC and you can create either monolithic or API only. The community is also big. If you combined a Domain Driven Development (DDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD) on Laravel then it will be a superb. Since you are using PHP more natural is Python - it can handle high traffic - Python is very effective in coding. Python is superset of Java and C++ - True Object Oriented and have very clear syntax (Spring is hard to learn and debug - you can be confused many times).It is human readable you can code 2-4 times faster with small speed sacrifice.Jinja2 is more faster/flexible Django - whatever Django is better with ORM.Flask is just proposal - many other options of web servers. I need to build a web application plus android and IOS apps for an enterprise, like an e-commerce portal. It will have intensive use of MySQL to display thousands (40-50k) of live product information in an interactive table (searchable, filterable), live delivery tracking. It has to be secure, as it will handle information on customers, sales, inventory.Here is the technology stack:Backend: Laravel 7Frondend: Vue.js, React or AngularJS? Need help deciding technology stack. Thanks. It's better to use Laravel with Vue.js and also laravel is very lightweight and speed performance. Go for Laravel 8 (not 7, obviously because it's the latest version and has a lot of new features and bug fixes) when it comes to backend coding. Go for Vue.js (if you don't have any preference) because it is having by default configuration setup in Laravel). Pick MySQL or PostgreSQL both work fine. If you know GCP, go for it, otherwise go for Heroku. Avoid spending time on hosting setup - prefer PaaS based solutions. In Laravel, try Laravel Breeze or Jetstream - these might make the development much faster - at least for the basic setup that is there. 40-50k should not be a problem at all for the database nor for any frontend/backend combo. Laravel works pretty well with Vue.js, for example; and you can include Elasticsearch in the combo if you really need fulltext search capabilites in your app. That will be much more decisive in the final product than the frontend stack chosen. I don't know anything really about CodeIgniter, but I do know that microservices are a great choice for e-commerce, as they tend to have a lot of different moving (but not necessarily connected) parts. That being said, and if you have a choice, I'd recommend Go personally. But node isn't the worst option if Go isn't something you're comfortable with. If you know typescript and want an entire framework to work with, go wth Angular. AngularJS, to my knowledge was deprecated. React is great, popular, and you'll find a ton of support. I highly recomand using the Vue based Nuxt framework for the front end. It is not required to use the server render feature and the folder based routing and stores are really nice to work with. In addition it brings component auto import and lots of plugins neatly integrated (authentication, i18n, socket.io, etc.). If in the setup process you also chose Vuetify as a component library you will cover 98% of needed components. As for Laravel vs CodeIginter I would chose Laravel as the safest bet. Sadly, CodeIgniter development slowed down after the main contributor's death.It is also worth mentioning, as others did, that the initial boost Vue got is from Laravel's creator and community. The simplicity and ease of use mindset is shared. I can't speak to Angular since I haven't used it for at least 3 years (I wasn't a fan back then) but both React and Vue are great frameworks and will do the job just fine. Since you are using Laravel for the back end I'd recommend Vue. There's a lot of overlap between the communities and most Laravel developers I know do favor Vue over React. If your customer is an enterprise, I'll strongly recommend leveraging Azure or AWS for building and hosting your backend. AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda + AWS RDS would be a good combination. You might want to run everything in your VPC if security / privacy are your top concerns. Laravel is the best tool in php and I know it also if i don't develop in php.Vue.js is the future. In combination with https://bootstrap-vue.org/ is THE solution. Best regards Hi. I am a backend developer in a company tasked with recoding a legacy application, choosing the right technology stack, and then later hiring for that stack. This is a freight/logistics application made 15 years ago in PHP with no modern framework used. In this application, customers from different countries login into theirs accounts and add a huge number of shipments, like let's say 500, and then, later on, generate PDFs for them after calling third-party APIs. This application has API integrations with lots of other companies and also offers API access to its own software as well. This application is also used in-house by warehouse people to scan different shipments using barcode scanners and to process shipments by performing different actions on them. The database being used currently is MySQL. Now we have the choice to write this application in a modern technology stack. Performance, speed, reliability, and security are the primary concerns here. Should I go with Java/Spring Boot with AngularJS as the front end or PHP/Laravel with Vue.js as the front end? Switching at this point from PHP to Java will not be hard if Java is considered better here because we can hire as per our final decision. Thanks. Hi Chris,I will suggest going with Laravel and MySQL since the existing system is already in PHP it will help a lot and easier to port out to Laravel and will save a lot of time.Laravel has a very robust mechanism to handle the jobs/Queues and it comes with a lot of features. Hi Chris,I recommend you to use Java with spring boot to rewrite your software. You will have the advantages of modern applications. The main challenge will be to cut your existing business logic to functional services (microservices) that will communicate each others. That will comes up also with the challenges of orchestrate those services but for that no worries.For the database also, will recommend Postgre too.For the front end, you can use angular, react or vue js with your backend since it will be API calls. Hope it can help! First of all, Java can give you definitely better speed, especially at scale. One benefit is that you can tune it for a better response time, and another one is when you'll have millions of requests per day it'll save you some infrastructure cost. But.. will you have millions of requests a day? How much does it matter if the API response time is 10ms or 50ms? Rewriting an existing project is a huge deal. It can take years(!), especially if the team hasn't done such a thing yet and especially if the tech stack gets completely replaced. So I argue against rewrite in the first place. There are two older articles on the topic, but their arguments are both valid as of today:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/https://www.jjinux.com/2008/05/joel-on-software-never-rewrite-from.html What I'd suggest instead is to learn refactoring strategies. Even if you have some routine with refactoring it is worth reading Fowler's refactoring book: https://book-programming.com/refactoring-books/ What I would do with a "frameworkless" PHP codebase is:- Add a framework (I would also go with Laravel, but Symfony or Phalcon would also do the job)- Isolate the existing codebase in a folder if possible without any actual changes- Route the requests through the framework (with a catch-all route) and forward the request to the existing codebase- Take a simple component/page to start with and replace the DB calls using Laravel's DB layer- Doing this "experiment", you'll have a strategy that you can apply to other components- Do the refactoring for views, controllers, etc, step by step- In case you have APIs and other kinds of components apply different strategies- Keep deploying as frequent as possible- Apply the learnings on the run and do pivots if needed There are many more details to this, but it exceeds the scope of this answer. About Java: last year I was part of, actually sparking the rewrite of an existing API from Symfony to Java using Spring Boot/JHipster. The bottom line is that it was a bad idea. We had a separate PM, an Engineering Manager, and a set of developers both Java and PHP, one of the developers highly experienced with the JHipster stack. We've got the support of the CEO, and despite his strong worries, the Head of Software gave it a green light too.After 20 months the old PHP system is still running and - of course - it has more features than the Java one, because life didn't stop, business demanded new features in the live system. Java and the whole ecosystem are very different, so even if you have people with battlefield experience with it, the complete rewrite is extremely risky. In my opinion, it's less of a technical than a business decision. I would sit down with the person(s) paying the bill for the refactoring. I would phrase the following questions and elaborate the answer together with them:- What is the problem we want to solve? (maintainability? speed? lack of people understanding the system? security?)- Is the system legacy only technically or also in the meaning "it no longer fits the business' reality"?- What are the expected outcomes of the refactoring?- What is the budget for the new/refactored system?- What is the timeframe allowed for the refactoring/rewrite?- How does the rewrite compare to refactoring, in terms of time, money, and complexity?- What happens with the development of new features during refactoring?- What resources will be assigned to the refactoring project? Springboot (you can see for "jhipster" for a quick start with spring/angularJs ) is used in many micro service enterprise applications (they are design for), so API integration is "as easy as ABC".With this you can scale and give an answer to some of your questions: performance, speed, reliability and security. But be carefull with the learning curve... NB:- For the DB, leave mysql and go to Postgres! their is no other option! you say thank you later! (a nosql database can be a nice tool too)- You have associated a front framework with a back framework, but they is no good reason to do that. You can use vuejs with springboot too (and i use them!) Being worked on both frameworks, I would suggest Spring Boot as it is really great when it comes to scalability. Laravel on the other hand provides great developer tools and a command line interface for the ease of development ( I really love the migrations in Laravel). If it is performance and scalability you are looking for then Spring Boot is your go to. It (and Java) has really matured over the years. Also, I would suggest you to consider Angular 2+ since AngularJs is obsolete. Depends on how much time and money the company is willing to invest... But I'd recommend at least getting a start on lifting and shifting to the cloud if you have the knowledge/ability. Lots of performance gains can be made as well as cost saving. Not to mention learning how to operate on the cloud is a great thing to put on any resume these days. Much easier to work with. And naturally integrates with Vue.js. Angular is in decline. Moreover, you already live in the PHP ecosystem. While I do both Java and PHP, onboarding into the PHP ecosystem is much faster. Any help? 234 views but not a single advice 🙁 Which is better of Laravel, Rails and Django for creating great products quickly? Which is better for creating open source apps that others might want to contribute to? I want a mature tool for creating web apps that qualifies for: I would have to learn Ruby, Python or PHP for each, so that factors in too. I'm proficient in React and Node.js, but I feel the node backend ecosystem is too immature with a million different ways to do everything, and too many decisions to make, too much wiring to get everything to work together, and too many packages that end up not being supported a few months down the line. Which would you choose for me to learn? Comparing them end-to-end, Rails comes the most productive in my opinion. But there are bolder parameters you may consider. i.e. no one switches from Django to Rails to improve productivity and vice versa (probably from Laravel to one of those two). The language's productivity also matters, which both Ruby and Python are better for that. There is a philosophical difference between #Django and #Rails : Django supports the "Explicit over Implicit" idea, making it easier for newcomers to understand what's going on. This idea also has downsides. This allows beginners to start working with Django without even learning Django and best practices and defer learning by using references like Stackoverflow.com, which is not a good idea because you potentially don't know things that you don't know! Also, you may find many different project styles. On the other hand, Rails support the "Convention over configuration" and Scaffolding idea. It's easier for a Rails developer to be added to a new project or just review a random Rails project. Everything has a default and also it has some downsides as well. e.g. As a beginner, everything feels like magic in Rails, and you don't understand what is going on and how Rails understand while you didn't "explicitly" say what do you want sometimes. Conclusion:Rails and Django are more productive and you can build projects on your own quickly (many giant startups launched this way!). P.S: for learning RoR I suggest the book/video from Michael Hartl. I picked Django because we use it at work. But honestly, if you don't know any of them, I would look at the jobs around where you live and learn the one that either has the most jobs posted or if you can look at the trends the one that is growing the number of jobs the most. All three would satisfy your needs and all three are good choices. Dotnet core would also be a good choice, again if there are jobs in your area for said technologies. If you literally don't care about this for employment, learn them all and just do it in alphabetical order :) Note: I think you are wrong about Node being too immature - there are also MOSTLY standards for everything you want to do on the backend that have not changed for many years. Rails uses too much magic and sugar. Laravel is something from the previous century. I'd say Django can be well balanced choice. I have extensive experience with all three. So, this advice based on practical projects I recommend Ruby/Rails. I write the text in question answer form: Yes you can use the prototyping in Rails or not. And this can be realized by adding any of testing framework like Cucumber or RSpec for example. Writing the test you can work on the application prototype without a change real code in production, or even development environment. Yes it is easy, you are able to use the capistrano gem with its modules, if required, to deploy application to production within a day. Since the Rails gets on itself the main code part of a data processing, you are able easily to generate the required code with build-in Rails or external gem generators, and to merely maintain the your code, if you would cover it with a test of selected test framework. As far as I said you can barely control a contribution to your project with using the test covering frameworks, to keep conformity the project. You can use React along with any JS NPM module easily using webpacker gem. Of course the Rails framework is supported by many three-side gems, which can be found at rubygems, that support the authentication (devise), storage feature (fog), db (pg/mysql/sqlite3), image handling (rmagick), backups (backup), change history (history) Ruby/Rails with the RubyGem ecosystem is actively envolving and not plan to be collapsed and abandned with of development both Ruby language and Rails framework. So, you can freely and fearlessly start using the Rails framework as server side base for your project. DJango after a little practice, with migrations and support to a lot of libraries and modules is very efficient to create small projects. Edit: Between Laravel, Django or RoR (Ruby on Rails) Hi, Which tool will you recommend: I need to build a web application, oriented to small businesses, like a small ERP. It will have intensive use of Sql to access a PostgreSQL database. It has to be secure, as it will handle information on customers, sales, inventory. If you think another tool will be better, please let that know. Thanks a lot Laravel and Postgres will be the better solutions you can add more like Redis for caching and React/Vue for the frontend. Check Spring, if security and reliability is needed along with Lots of Database , check Spring Data, spring web, spring security What will be better Laravel or Node.js to handle a logistics portal which displays thousands (20-50k) of delivery data information in an interactive table (searchable, filterable), live delivery tracking, basic user management, and report creation? Data comes usually in CSV (manually uploaded or via API from courier companies). Live tracking uses checks tracking numbers on the courier page using API. My question for you is: "Which one are you familiar with?" Following your needs, both could do it, but think about it.Now talking about Node.js, in my opinion, if you use JavaScript, there are lots of packages to support your entire project, including native ones for testing TDD and others for BDD. Also the best support on AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Laravel is so very friendly in coding in backend and has a good documentation and easy to understand. It's also easy and rapid to create application on this framework. The community is also big where you can get a lot of other solutions from other developers. Same as well in Vue Js, its lightweight and very fast to compile and load. The coding is very well structured and clean. PHP has now also the features of strict type rules and Vue Js too since it's now support Typescript. For a full-stack app or just simple APIs I'd go 100% with Laravel. You get a clean architecture, beautiful documentation and friendly and always growing community: the project is yours, from A to Z. With their docs and resources like Laracast you can start from zero and build what you want, when you want. The learning curve is definitely smaller when compared to Symfony and, with the help of a bit of "magic" (Facades etc.) you get the same results in the half of the time with cleaner code. I am planning to develop project management system SAAS based.Can any one help me with selection of platforms from Django or Laravel and for database MongoDB or Firebase/Firestore or MySql?On front end I am going to use Quasar Framework (VueJS).Note : project will be Webapp, Mobile app and desktop app. i find python quite resourceful. given the bulk of libraries that python has and the trends of the tech i find django which runs on python to be the framework of choice to the upcoming web services and application. Laravel on the other hand which is powered by PHP is also quite resourceful and great for startups and common web applications. When I started on this project as the sole developer, I was new to web development and I was looking at all of the web frameworks available for the job. I had some experience with Ruby on Rails and I had looked into .net for a bit, but when I found Laravel, it felt like the best framework for me to get the product to market.What made me choose Laravel was the easy to read documentation and active community. Rails had great documentation, but lacked some features built in that I wanted out of the box, while .net had a ton of video documentation tutorials, but nothing as straightforward as Laravels.So far, I am happy with the decision I made, and looking forward to the website release!

Whenever developers think of the best PHP frameworks for creating modern websites, the two names that come in front are Laravel and CodeIgniter. Both these frameworks are loved and used by a large number of web developers.&nbsp; So, there is always a debate about Laravel vs CodeIgniter. Students and novice developers generally think about which is the best framework for them among CodeIgniter and Laravel. Therefore, in this blog, we will compare CodeIgniter with Laravel and see which is the best choice for you. Overview What Is Laravel? Laravel is an open-source PHP web framework. Taylor Otwell created Laravel as an attempt to give a modern alternative to the CodeIgniter framework. Its architectural patterns are mostly Symfony-based. This framework gained popularity after the release of version 3. Version 3 of Laravel offers powerful features such as the Artisan Command Line Interface, migrations and database support, etc. It has also launched a new packaging system, Bundles. Laravel is now one of the most popular backend development technology.&nbsp; The first stable version of Laravel was released in June 2011. The current stable version, 5.6, was released in February 2018, with versions 5.7 and 5.8 in September 2018, February 2019, March 2020, and February 2022.&nbsp; What Is CodeIgniter? CodeIgniter is an open-source web framework. Developers use CodeIgniter to develop dynamic web pages and websites using the PHP programming language. Many developers and entrepreneurs regard it as one of the top open-source technologies. This framework uses MVC (Model View Controller Framework) approach and depends on loosely coupled systems. The CodeIgniter allows developers to modify the Hierarchical View Controller (HMVC). Developers can organize views, controllers and models into modular groups. They can also be organized into subdirectories. This framework is faster than some other PHP frameworks and has fast responsiveness.&nbsp; The first version of CodeIgniter was released in 2006. CodeIgniter 4 is the latest version of CodeIgniter, initially released in 2020. Laravel Vs CodeIgniter Know the Differences Now let’s look at Laravel vs CodeIgniter frameworks: Inbuilt Modules Laravel was created with modularity in mind. Developers can break down projects into smaller, more manageable modules with the bundle. This feature is missing in CodeIgniter, along with any built-in modularity. So, developers require a modular extension to create and save modules. Unit Testing By using PHP unit, Laravel makes it possible for developers to dive into the code of an application without being interrupted by the PHP Unit. On the other hand, CodeIgniter does not include a built-in tool for unit testing. CodeIgniter developers will need to rely on additional unit testing assistance in order to assess the code and evaluate the app&#8217;s value. Database Model Laravel uses relational and object-oriented database models. On the other hand, CodeIgniter uses the object-oriented database model. Programming Paradigm Programming paradigm is important to Laravel uses the component-oriented programming paradigm. At the same time, CodeIgniter uses Object-oriented, event-driven, and functional programming paradigm. Authentication The authentication class trait makes it simple for developers to apply authentication and permission rules in Laravel. On the other hand, Codeigniter doesn&#8217;t have any built-in authentication features. As a result, developers must create custom CodeIgniter extensions to authenticate and authorise users. Construction Laravel&#8217;s filing system is based on the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. It contains the &#8216;Artisan&#8217; command-line utility. CodeIgniter&#8217;s architecture is based on the MVC architectural pattern. It allows for a simple and smooth onboarding process. However, object-oriented programming is used initially to create the pattern. Developers customised it to meet their needs. Template Engine Popularity is important to consider in Laravel vs CodeIgniter. Laravel offers Blade, a simple and powerful template engine. The Blade engine optimizes the web application performance by modifying and elevating views. On the other hand, Codeigniter does not have a built-in template engine. The developers must integrate Smarty, a third-party templating engine tool. It allows them to do all the common tasks and improve the performance of websites. DBMS Support Laravel supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, ORACLE, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, orientDB, and JDBC. At the same time, CodeIgniter supports MongoDB, Microsoft BI, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. It also supports DB2, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. HTTP Support Laravel can be used by programmers to explain custom HTTP routes. Laravel developers can create unique URLs for each HTTP route. On the other hand, Codeigniter does not fully support HTTP. Therefore, CodeIgniter developers can use URLs to protect data delivery by constructing pathways. Laravel Vs CodeIgniter Popularity We can decide on Laravel Vs CodeIgniter&#8217;s popularity on the basis of the number of Google searches for both terms over the past few years. Below is the Google search trend graph for Laravel and CodeIgniter, depicting the past 5 years of worldwide searches.

Introduction to Laravel and CodeIgniter What is Laravel? &#8211; An Overview Laravel is an open-sourced web framework known for its server-side handling of routing, HTML authentication, templating, and more. Created by Taylor Otwell, Laravel is written in PHP and is based on Symfony that provides reusable PHP components/libraries. Since it is a server-side-based framework, with Laravel, you can build applications with pre-defined architectures, customized backend logic, web portal, templates, and full-stack apps as well as manage SaaS products.   What is CodeIgniter? &#8211; An Overview CodeIgniter is a strong PHP framework with a minimal digital footprint designed for developers who prefer a simplistic and rich toolkit to develop full-featured web applications. Built by EllisLab in 2006, this framework is one of the PHP frameworks available to generate dynamic websites utilizing PHP.  It gives users absolute freedom and no dependency on the MVC development pattern. This framework sanctions third-party plugins that facilitate the use of complex functionalities. Market Usage Statistics &#8211; Laravel vs CodeIgniter Market usage stats of Laravel Market usage stats of CodeIgniter Pros and Cons of Laravel and CodeIgniter Pros of Laravel Pre-packaged tools: Facilitates common tasks required for building web applications by offering ready-to-use packages for user authentication, testing APIs.  Templating system: Uses a templating engine known as Blade, which offers enormous power to format data and create complex web-app layouts with easy navigation. It allows the addition of new modules and features without making any change in the core.  Automation with Artisan CLI: Offers the ability to automate any kind of recurring task which is application-specific. It generates modern boilerplate codes to manage databases, migrations, and implement custom commands conveniently.  Routing: Reverse routing is a unique feature that supports the automatic propagation of changes in routes into relevant links. In other words, it automatically creates Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).   Automated testing: Offers expressive testing methods with PHPUnit that simulates user behavior by making requests to the application’s functions. This way, testing is less time-consuming and automated.    Cons of Laravel Lightweight: Typically, the lightweight feature of this framework is considered an advantage, but in this framework, the lightweight nature leads to excessive backend congestion of database queries, ultimately leading to lower performance with an increase in data congestion.    Library quality: While Laravel might be open-sourced and backed by a vast community, it also leads to an increase in less reliable third-party libraries. Community: Since the Laravel community is considerably large, the number of third-party libraries built and published is significant. It becomes difficult to evaluate which library is reliable and quality certified. Pros of CodeIgniter Security: Provides application customization and helps strengthen its security. The framework makes it easier to build security protocols for specific organizational needs. Modularity: Collaborates with Expression Engine to support the developers for built-in user authentication and ease of getting into modular applications. Expression Engine is a flexible platform with ready-to-use templates.  User-friendly Interface: Whether you are developing a web app full of dynamic functionality or a responsive website experience, CodeIgniter offers enhanced UI with flexibility. Active developer community: The vibrant and active support group extensively contributes to ready-to-use source codes to enhance web development. In comparison with other frameworks, CodeIgniter offers more organized and extensive documentation. Hassle-free migration: Lets users migrate seamlessly from one server to another despite the colossal data. This makes CodeIgniter a preferred choice to address the technical glitches developers suffer otherwise with migration.  Cons of CodeIgniter  Unstable code maintainability: It’s tedious for developers to update, modify, and maintain the code, consuming a good amount of time. Absent Exhaustive Libraries: Compared to the new-age PHP frameworks, this one provides an exhaustive list of libraries that might leave it behind. Dormant Growth: Development and growth have become stagnant with lesser updates, which has resulted in versions going out of sync. Laravel vs. Symfony: Similarities & Differences of Two PHP Frameworks Use cases &#8211; Laravel vs. CodeIgniter Use cases of Laravel Use cases of CodeIgniter Popular applications built with Laravel and CodeIgniter Popular apps using Laravel as a backend technology Popular apps using CodeIgniter as a backend technology Laravel vs CodeIgniter performance comparison How does Laravel stand out in terms of performance? The performance of Laravel-based applications can have implications on the success of a project, and it is said to be slow. But, its community suggests that it can be improved for better performance if optimized appropriately, which may allow applications to perform efficiently even under 20ms. Usage of Cache tags allow applications to quickly load the pre-stored information that allows a faster response time, leading to improved performance. CodeIgniter &#8211; Performance &amp; speed comparison CodeIgniter-based applications are run through a functional test to determine the performance. Few projects have also demonstrated various response times based on the number of users. For example, the average response time to run the application with 100 users was 11.5 sec. On the other hand, with 500 users, it was 45.6 sec and with 1100 users, it recorded 26.0 sec. These projects showed how robust and scalable CodeIgniter can perform.  Laravel vs CodeIgniter application architecture When choosing a framework, it’s important to choose flexibility and avoid any strict enforcement of architecture and guidelines.  As a matter of fact, it’s always recommended to treat a framework as a guide, not methods and standards. That said, let’s juxtapose Laravel and CodeIgniter with each other and check whether they are flexible in terms of architecture. What kind of architecture does Laravel support? Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that provides the ability to split developer roles for a more comfortable development process. In other words, while a frontend developer is working on the views, a backend developer can be working on the controller logic simultaneously.  The MVC patterns also offer full control over the application, which might come in handy to choose application-specific routes and customize how your application appears on a global scale. This improves the SEO of the application in return as well. Implementing external APIs and reusing application logic is effortless with Laravel&#8217;s MVC architecture. Thus, the creation of immutable backend support for any web application is always possible. CodeIgniter &#8211; Application architecture CodeIgniter is based on the Model-View-Controller model. The MVC architecture allows web pages to include minimal scripting and test-built modules. This test-driven development approach saves time, boosts productivity, and facilitates integration with Javascript frameworks.  Scalability Is Laravel scalable? Popular apps using Laravel for years are scaling up their applications without any limitation. Laravel inherits scalability from PHP as it proffers support to rapidly growing businesses. By choosing a good database and load balancer, Laravel can achieve massive horizontal scaling.  Laravel applications can be scaled as per requirement by using MySQL, AWS and some advanced caching methods. Is CodeIgniter scalable? CodeIgniter is lightweight, making it a go-to for highly scalable applications. It has no real overhead or conventions as it loads only what is requested. You can achieve scalability by caching modifications without disrupting the performance. However, scaling a web app is a science that has little to do with the language or framework itself. It&#8217;s important that you create sophisticated system architecture and evaluate the technical capabilities of the database layer, best practices like using more servers, caching, horizontal/ vertical scaling. Ease of Testing How easier is it to test a Laravel app? Given the fact that Laravel functions with PHP, there are many testing tools available to ensure the creation of a bug-free application. However, it is understandable to feel overwhelmed by the number of tools and resources available for testing. To make the testing process more comfortable, Laravel tests code in two distinct levels known as Unit tests and Feature tests.  Laravel, by default, has a robust testing documentation and provides all the tools you need to test the application environment at several levels, including the ability to conduct mock tests by mocking application codes and events. How easier is it to test a CodeIgniter app? CodeIgniter provides a simplistic unit-testing class that enables you to write tests for your applications. It has an evaluation function along with two result functions that may not perform a full-blown test but acts as a simple tool to evaluate your code quality for accurate results. They run by initializing class and generating reports and also provide customized templates to show tests. Microservices Compatibility &#8211; Laravel vs CodeIgniter Is Laravel compatible with microservices architecture? PHP supports microservices architecture, and it is evident that Laravel supports microservices architecture as well. How does Laravel do it? The app is broken down modularly into small building blocks, each with its function and responsibility. These functions communicate with each other using language-agnostic APIs, and as a result, the app becomes compatible with the microservices architecture.  For the past few months, the need to use Laravel with microservices architecture was so intense that a developer came up with a framework – Lumen. It serves a similar purpose and is a leaner, smaller, and lighter version of Laravel. Is CodeIgniter compatible with microservices architecture? This framework lets you leverage PHP’s full-stack tools to build efficient and robust microservices. The microservice-architectural approach serves best in the test-driven web app with CodeIgniter 3 and fills gaps in your architecture. What’s more, it also streamlines code and builds an infrastructure to handle and integrate data for optimal automated results. Consequently, you get maximum scalability, performance, and database support. Database Support How good is the database support for Laravel? Laravel currently supports four database system types: Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL. The fluent query builder, raw SQL, and Eloquent ORM make the process of interacting with these databases simple. Even establishing multiple database connections is more comfortable to configure with Laravel.  Whether other databases will support Laravel, only the future can tell. But say, you are comfortable with the databases that Laravel supports, you will face no limitations in creating a wholly controlled relationship between the database and the web app. How good is the database support for CodeIgniter? CodeIgniter comes with a full-featured, high-speed abstracted database class that supports both traditional structures and Query Builder patterns. Its clear and simple syntax makes it a preferred choice for developers across the globe. Following are some drivers through which you can access the databases: Community Support &#8211; Laravel vs CodeIgniter How big is the community around Laravel? PHP holds 79% of the market when it comes to server-side programming of web applications. Laravel has a vast community with more than 1,165,900 active users, 18,105 threads, 26.9k Github stars, and 4.7k real-time watchers. The maximum time taken to resolve a Laravel query by the community is not more than three days. PHP and Laravel combined has a powerful community, where developers share Laravel podcasts, news, documents, repositories, etc. Following are some of the places where you can meet the Laravel community: How big is the community around CodeIgniter? The CodeIgniter community is an open-source, vibrant, and active space where members collect and exchange ideas. It has 7.9k active users on Github with an 18.2k-star rating and 1.7k real-time watchers. What’s more, web developers who are active community members are more functional. Here are some more communities you may want to join: Hiring Developers How convenient is it to hire Laravel developers? With the vast community of PHP and Laravel worldwide, it is no rocket-science to hire a Laravel developer. You can almost find a Laravel developer in every corner. But it is essential to keep in mind that rookies might find it challenging to handle its advanced features. Hence, the ones you hire must have the know-how of handling Artisan, Eloquent ORM, and caching. The average charge for employing a Laravel developer is around $15 to $30 per hour. Laravel also offers an official platform to find Laravel developers. How convenient is it to hire CodeIgniter developers? Hiring CodeIgniter developers is easy and convenient with options like hourly, project-wise, or full-time basis. It is recommended to hire an expert web development company to build CodeIgniter web app solutions for your project demands. The average hourly rate to hire CodeIgniter developers is $61 &#8211; $80. Conclusion Laravel has the advantage of pre-defined architecture that makes customization of backend logic easier. At the same time, CodeIgniter offers ease of testing for scalable applications.

Laravel includes precise and easy-to-read syntax outlines with source code available on GitHub coupled with MIT License. It excels by decreasing the overall development time and resources in mandatory development processes like routing, authentication, sessions, caching, etc. Since the Laravel framework is specific and follows communicative language norms, it is termed a highly reliable PHP framework. CodeIgniter Framework: CodeIgniter is a highly strong and proven PHP framework that lets you develop feature-filled web apps. It has proven to be the ideal type of framework to develop robust websites with attractive functionalities yet in a simple manner. This framework lets for the inclusion of complex features by integration of 3rd party plugins. Another distinct feature of Laravel is that it does not strictly follow the MVC pattern but the apprehension of security is the same as Laravel. Due to this, there will not be any mandatory dependency on the MVC pattern and the developers are flexible to develop strong web apps. Major differences between CodeIgniter and Laravel Framework:&nbsp; While Laravel is component-oriented, CodeIgniter is an object-oriented and event-driven framework. Laravel and Codeigniter both are equally capable frameworks in PHP development. They consist of their importance and advantages in performing according to the goal of the developers. It is observed that CodeIgniter is comparatively simple to use but Laravel has several exciting functionalities but they are a bit intricate to be used for minimally experienced developers. Both types of frameworks provide unique benefits that have to be chosen by developers according to their needs and precise project requirements. Below are key differences: Database Model:&nbsp; As Codeigniter is an object-oriented model it will store the data as an object with the key focus on inheriting and encapsulating the data. Laravel is a component-oriented model that stores the data in the form of entities developing a link between connected tables in the database. Helping RESTful API:&nbsp; In Laravel, the RESTful controllers hold the ability to push the engineers in creating a variety of REST APIs without the requirement of wasting more time in the process. But, CodeIgniter does not push for updated and organized development of the REST APIs.   Template Engine: Updated versions in the CodeIgniter framework are not having any in-built template engine as the app engineers must employ the relatively scalable template and organize it for robust app development. The stable version of Laravel emerges with Blade - an integrated in-built template engine. Maintenance and construction:&nbsp; The file structure of Laravel is dependent on the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern which includes a command-line tool dubbed the Artisan. But the structure of Code Ignitor does not strictly follow the MVC pattern while stimulating onboarding. As it is an object-oriented programming structure several engineers customize it to their needs. Even the template engine of the Laravel is easy to use but strong like Blade which provides the developers to enhance the performance of the web app by altering and increasing the views. Codeigniter does not have any integrated template engine; hence the developers must perform the task of integration with other smart engine templates which is crucial in carrying out regular activities and enhancing the website functioning. In-built components:&nbsp; Laravel excels in this segment by the inclusion of in-built features that helps the engineers to take every project in smaller parts and accomplish them individually. But CodeIgniter does not have any in-built components that force developers to develop them and maintain them for longer with appropriate extensions. Aid for Unit testing:&nbsp; Laravel consists of an in-built testing tool called PHPUnit that continuously assesses the app code by carrying out effective unit testing. This will make sure that there are no open defects in the product and it is running smoothly. CodeIgniter does not consist of any in-built unit testing aid which pushes for using an external unit-testing tool for verifying the working of the product. Which one to choose among these Web Framework: CodeIgniter or Laravel?&nbsp; Both CodeIgniter and Laravel web frameworks are beneficial in their way. If you are looking to choose among the best PHP framework, it rests assured that both CodeIgniter and Laravel are proven for diverse purposes. Selecting between these two is completely reliant on your specific business requirements and the motives of that entire project.

Laravel Laravel is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern that makes it easy for developers to work together due to a tight separation between logic and presentation layers. As a result, the development of large applications using Laravel becomes easy. CodeIgniter Unlike other PHP frameworks out there, CodeIgniter doesn’t force developers to implement the MVC model but encourages them to fast-track and simplify the development of complex web applications. Symfony  Like other PHP frameworks, Symfony also follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern that separates the business logic from the presentation layer. Database Support When working with a database, you would indeed like to know whether the PHP framework you have selected is supported by databases you’re familiar with. Isn’t, it right? So, let’s have a look at database support for each framework. Laravel At present, Laravel supports four databases &#8211; MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and SQL Server. CodeIgniter CodeIgniter comes prepacked with a full-featured and quite fast abstracted database class that provides support for both traditional structures as well as Query Builder patterns. Here are a few supported databases for the framework: MySQL (5.1+) via the MySQLi driver, MSSQL via the SQLSRV driver and PostgreSQL via the Postgre driver. Symfony Symfony comes with all necessary tools to use databases in web applications due to Doctrine &#8211; the suite of PHP libraries to work with databases. As a result, the framework supports numerous databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB &#8211; to name a few.

Preferred by almost every experienced developer, Laravel has a higher popularity curve than CodeIgniter. CodeIgniter displays ease of usage in 2.x. Thus, many web developers put their hands on CodeIgniter popularity. Laravel vs CodeIgniter Template Language Laravel: Blade template engineCodeIgniter: PHP Proprietary template engine. Laravel vs CodeIgniter Database Model Laravel: Relational object-orientedCodeIgniter: Object-oriented Laravel vs CodeIgniter Programming Paradigm Laravel: Component OrientedCodeIgniter: Object oriented event driven functional Quick Read: Laravel vs CodeIgniter Construction Laravel generally follows the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern of filing. It holds a command-line tool called the &#8216;Artisan&#8217;. The structure of CodeIgniter is an MVC architectural pattern. It supplies easy and smooth onboarding. The pattern was initially based on object-oriented programming. However, developers used it according to their requirements. CodeIgniter Vs Laravel Inbuilt Modules Laravel is created with inbuilt modularity features. It enables developers to break a certain project into tiny trivial modules via the bundle. CodeIgniter lacks this feature and does not deliver any inbuilt modularity. Hence, developers need to generate and store modules using Modular Extension. CodeIgniter vs Laravel Database Schema Migration As such, no particular features exist that help eases the database schema migration in CodeIgnitor however, in Laravel, it is significantly possible to make a considerable difference between both CodeIgniter and Laravel. CodeIgniter Vs Laravel API Building And Template Engine Laravel has an uncomplicated yet vigorous template engine, Blade. The Blade engine allows performance optimization of the web application by manipulating and elevating views. Codeigniter does not involve any in-built template engine. The developers need to incorporate it with a third-party templating engine tool- Smarty. This enables them to perform all common tasks besides enhancing the CodeIgniter website performance and benchmark. CodeIgniter vs Laravel Routing Laravel offers vast libraries and routing options for web development; additionally, it is effective and adaptable when sending routing requests. Codelighter, on the other hand, also has routing support; it supports implicit and explicit routing options for web development. Whereas, in comparison to Laravel, it is far less effective and adaptable. CodeIgniter Vs Laravel Eloquent or Active Record CodeIgniter possesses a modified version of the Active Record Database Pattern, which allows managing the operations database with minimal coding, accompanied by more secure queries, as the system automatically escapes the values. (CodeIgniter) Example to get a specific user by id: Whereas Laravel utilizes Eloquent as the ORM, integrating automatic paging efficiently, relationships one-to-one, many-to-many, polymorphic, validations, field protection like a mass assignment, array / json generation, and dynamic queries based on model properties which makes it easy to generate queries to the database. (Laravel) Example to get a specific user by id: Laravel vs CodeIgniter Performance Benchmark Both Laravel and CodeIgniter observe some differences in terms of performance. Laravel is slower in performance and concentrates more on the project&#8217;s success. However, it is not a drawback as the Laravel performance can be improved by proper optimization, which allows apps to perform effectively under 20ms speed. The cache tags also contribute to enhancing the performance as they allow the app to load the pre-stored information first with faster response time and better performance; On the other hand, the CodeIgniter apps work via functional tests to determine the performance. A few projects portray the various response times based on the number of users. For instance, the average response time to run the app was 11.5 seconds with 100 users, 45.6 seconds for 500 users, and 26.0 seconds for 1100 users. CodeIgniter Vs Laravel Unit Testing Laravel enables developers to look into the application code keenly without any interruption with the help of the PHP Unit. CodeIgniter lacks the inbuilt unit testing tool. As a result, CodeIgniter developers need to utilize additional unit testing support to assess the code and the value of the application. CodeIgniter Vs Laravel HTTP Support Laravel enables programmers to explain custom HTTP routes. In other words, Laravel developers can generate a separate URL for every HTTP route.

Before starting with a discussion on Laravel vs Codeigniter, you have to understand what both terms mean. Laravel is defined as a PHP open-source framework used in the development of web applications. The framework is based on the model view controller&#8217;s design pattern, which is why projects developed using this framework are more structured and manageable. This framework uses the available functionality of the central framework while using its features too. This framework retains all the features of the previous one. The web application developed using this feature is more secure in terms of hacking. The style and syntax of Laravel are more elegant. CodeIgniter is a PHP open-source framework, which is easy to understand and easy for learners to start developing. Laravel as Codeigniter is considered as the PHP web framework due to its inbuilt advanced features with high popularity. The market share of Laravel is double in comparison to Codeigniter. The Codeigniter has been popular among web developers for the past 14 years. Both frameworks are used for web development globally. CodeIgniter is popular in 43 countries, whereas Laravel leads in 113 countries. Codeigniter vs Laravel which is better? Improved utilization of ORM Laravel, unlike Codeigniter, allows the web developers to use eloquent ORM fully. Laravel uses the framework of protest social mapper (ORM) with an assortment of databases effectively through the ActiveRecord execution. The persuasive ORM allows clients to work with databases utilizing a particular model of individual database tables. It can also use the model to get normal undertakings focused on embedding new records and running database inquiries. More RESTFul state control over traditional controller methods. The RESTful Controllers offered by Laravel allow web developers to develop a variety of REST APIs without extra time and effort, putting additional time and exertion. The developers can set the Restful property in the RESTful Controller to develop custom REST APIs without using supportive code. On the other hand, it is not mandatory in Codeigniter to streamline the development of REST APIs. The clients are required to develop extra code for the development of REST APIs for web applications. The comparison in Unit testing support The rating of Laravel is more as compared to other PHP structures in the classification of unit testing. Laravel allows developers to check the application code along with PHPUnit. PHPUnit has an assortment of out-of-box augmentations. On the contrary, Codeigniter does not have inherent unit testing apparatuses. In this case, software developers must utilize extra unit testing devices for application code in the development procedure. Considering all these points, one can say that Laravel is an improved framework over CodeIgniter due to its coding pattern with the elegant look. Laravel also supports robust application development without the wastage of time. The outlook of Codeigniter and Laravel in 2021 The performance benchmark of Laravel vs Codeigniter There are differences in the performance of Laravel vs Codeigniter Laravel The performance of the Laravel application is slow, with implications on the success of a project. The web developing community that uses Laravel mentions that its performance can be improved if optimized appropriately, allowing applications to perform efficiently under 20ms speed. Cache tags allow the application to load the pre-stored information quickly with faster response time and improved performance. CodeIgniter The Codeigniter-related applications work through the functional test to determine the performance. Few projects depict various response times focused on the number of users. For example, the average response time to run the application was 11.5 seconds with 100 users, 45.6 seconds for 500 users, and 26.0 seconds for 1100 users. These project examples depict the robust and scalable performance of Codeigniter. The application structure of Codeigniter vs Laravel The concept of flexibility is most important in choosing a framework, as it will help avoid strict implementation of architecture and guidelines. The framework should be considered as a guide, not as methods and standards. The application architecture of Laravel Laravel uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that offers the ability to split the roles of developers in a comfortable development process. The frontend developer is focused on working on the views, a backend developer is focused on working on the controller logic. The MVC patterns offer complete control over application and application-specific routes. It also allows customizing the appearance of applications on a global scale. The pattern enhances the SEO of the application while implementing external APIs. Reusing application logic can be effortless using the MVC architecture in Laravel. Thus, the development of consistent backend support for web applications is always easy. The application architecture of Codeigniter CodeIgniter is related to the Model-View-Controller model. This architecture allows web pages to include reduced scripting and test-built modules. The test-driven development approach helps in saving time, improved productivity, and enables integration with Javascript frameworks. The ease of testing in Codeigniter vs Laravel app Laravel app There are many testing tools available to test the function of this PHP app, which is also known as a malware-free application. There are two distinct levels of Laravel testing which include Unit tests and Feature tests. Laravel has robust testing documentation by default and offers the tools to test the application environment at different levels, including the capacity to perform mock tests by mocking application codes and events. Codeigniter app Codeigniter proposes a unit-testing class that allows users to write the test for their Codeigniter applications. The application has an evaluation function with two result functions that cannot complete a full-blown test. Still, on the other side, it acts as an easy tool to calculate your code quality for precise results. They run by preparing the class and creating reports and also offer customized templates to display tests. The pros and cons of Laravel Advantages of Laravel Disadvantages of Laravel The pros and cons of Codeigniter Advantages of Codeigniter Disadvantages of Codeigniter The key differences between Laravel and Codeigniter The important differences between both are listed below briefly Conclusion In the end, we can conclude that these PHP frameworks have their relevance and benefits.

Privacy Overview EDUCBA Codeigniter vs Laravel By Priya Pedamkar  Difference Between Codeigniter vs Laravel In this article, we will see an outline on Codeigniter vs Laravel. PHP is a programming language used for dynamic web page development. PHP was meant to stand for Personal Home Page, which was later renamed to Hypertext Preprocessor. Over three quarters, websites are developed using this scripting language. It has gained rapid popularity as it can be executed as CLI (Command Line Interface), Embedded into Hypertext, or used in combination with Web Framework, Web templates or content management systems. This efficiency has brought PHP on the focus point; quite a few free, open-source web framework have been developed around it. This includes CodeIgniter and Laravel. EllsiLab designed CodeIgniter in 2006 with the objective of creating a faster and lighter web framework. Developers later maintained it from BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology). In 2011, Taylor Otwell found CodeIgniter lacking key features like User Authentication and Authorization and hence realized the need to develop Laravel. It included these features much more. Both are free, open-source PHP web frameworks that work on MVC Architecture. They have great benefits and relevance depending on the developer and the project that he is working on.

CodeIgniter is a developer-friendly tool that offers faster performance, easy configuration, secured and organized structure. However, it does not support the Inbuilt module creation. On the other hand, Laravel is planned and executed as per the developer’s creativity. He needs to select the module as per the service needed on his website and can integrate it through his development. 8. 10. An Easy to learn a framework that’s based on pure PHP with no template engine, CodeIgniter has a less learning curve. Laravel is a fairly simple tool to start with; however, with developers&#8217; increasing capability and expertise, his awareness to use different available modules would impact the benefits and features incorporated in the website. 11. While the documentations are available for both PHP frameworks for training and guidance, Laravel has abundant training and guidance available through documentations and videos on Laracast. These tutorials cover the complete information to learn and adapt to Laravel. Their repository on Github is extensive. It helps a newcomer to pick up this tool quickly and perform the task. As the community of CodeIgniter isn’t as big, the support is also comparatively less. Comparison Table of CodeIgniter vs Laravel The table below summarizes the comparisons between Codeigniter vs Laravel: Conclusion Laravel and CodeIgniter are both Free to use, Open source PHP framework that uses MVC structure. They come with different usability and features. The developer can choose its basis his capabilities and business requirement. While CodeIgniter is a preferred choice for MVC, easy Setup and quick learner, Laravel has opted for clean Architecture, elegant style and larger community support. While Laravel has been more popular among developers and has over 53K GitHub stars against CodeIgniter, which has 17K GitHub stars. They vary by usability and capability of tools and the features that the developer wants to use. With the efficiency of a website being a priority, CodeIgniter will be a preference, while for functionality, Laravel will be preferred.

Recent Posts E-commerce Codeigniter vs Laravel Comparison 2021 When building highly customizable websites, a PHP framework is usually the best tool to use. CodeIgniter and Laravel are two of the most popular frameworks PHP available. While CodeIgniter and Laravel share similarities, there are more differences between them. This guide will evaluate the differences that exist between both PHP frameworks. You will also know what framework is best for your e-commerce solution. Let’s go! Understanding Differences Between Laravel and CodeIgniter Laravel is an open-source PHP framework that uses a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. Based on Symfony, Laravel is suitable for developing dynamic web applications, such as online e-commerce sites. CodeIgniter on the other hand, is a popular PHP framework used by developers wanting to create complex web applications. Like Laravel, CodeIgniter makes it easy to create highly dynamic and customizable online sites. Both Laravel and CodeIgniter use MVC architecture, which promotes code re-usability and quickens the web design process. And both use the PHP framework, which is notable for enhancing website scalability. But, beyond those similarities, Laravel and CodeIgniter have little in common. In subsequent paragraphs, we’ll go deeper into these differences and explain the pros and cons of each framework. Which Is Better — CodeIgniter or Laravel? As is common with most web framework comparisons, it’s hard to say which is better between CodeIgniter and Laravel. What web framework you eventually choose will reflect the unique needs of your project. For the most part, Laravel seems to be the more popular option among the two. Per statistics, Laravel has more market share than CodeIgniter. But what works for others may not work for you. So, we’ll compare both web frameworks under different categories. That way, coming to a decision will be easier, as you’ll have the facts and details. MVC Architecture Like we highlighted earlier, both Laravel and CodeIgniter use Model View Controller (MVC) patterns. Because an MVC pattern lets developers re-use code for multiple projects, it reduces time spent on web design. Laravel has an expansive MVC architecture that provides more documentation than that of CodeIgniter. While its MVC pattern is limited, CodeIgniter’s variant is easier to master and set up. This makes it better for small-scale, personal web solutions. Another unique quality of the CodeIgniter is that it’s not compulsory for web developers to work within the MVC structure. This distinguishes it from Laravel and other frameworks using MVC architecture. For small projects like low-scale e-commerce solutions, CodeIgniter’s MVC architecture is suitable. However, you might prefer the Laravel MVC pattern if you intend to build a large e-commerce enterprise project. Support resources (libraries and templates) Laravel uses an in-built template system called Blade. The presence of a template engine makes it easy for web developers to optimize performance of web applications. CodeIgniter is, however, lagging in this area, as it lacks an in-built template engine. You’d have to integrate a template engine with the framework to execute common tasks. Also, Laravel has more libraries compared to CodeIgniter. While CodeIgniter has a few libraries, they are smaller in size. This is likely because CodeIgniter aims to have an extremely light footprint. So, if an expansive library and the presence of a template system are necessary for you, then Laravel is better. Again, this will depend on the type and scale of your project. Database Databases are very integral to the success of e-commerce platforms. Both Laravel and CodeIgniter support DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. But CodeIgniter also supports other databases like MongoDB, Microsoft Bi, JDBC, and orientDB. From this, it’s obvious that CodeIgniter supports more databases than Laravel. Laravel uses an object-relational mapping (ORM) database model while CodeIgniter uses an object-oriented (OODB) database model. Laravel’s Eloquent ORM structure aids direct interaction with databases via the specific model of individual database tables. But CodeIgniter’s OODB database is said to return faster and more consistent queries. For business, and especially e-commerce needs, Laravel is a better option, with its eloquent ORM database model. In an ORM database structure, information is tabled and objects have defined relationships. Thus, web applications can return complex relationships in response to user queries. Maintenance The Laravel framework has a major preoccupation with easy maintenance. If you have a site that’ll undergo routine changes over time, using Laravel to build is advisable. Say you have a small online store but plan to expand it to a bigger e-commerce marketplace with thousands of products. Utilizing Laravel, with high customization, from scratch will make it easier for the developer to implement changes later on. CodeIgniter isn’t your best friend if you plan to modify or update your web application. Part of the problem is that it doesn’t support modular separation of code. Hence, the unlucky developer in charge of updating your site will have to rewrite lots of code. Ease of use CodeIgniter is clearly the winner when it comes to ease of use. Ask any developer, and he’ll likely tell you CodeIgniter is easier to learn and implement in comparison to Laravel. CodeIgniter emphasizes a light footprint, and has few features you have to master. In contrast, Laravel uses more tools and features, all of which you have to master before you can use the framework. For small-scale e-commerce solutions looking to stay small, CodeIgniter is recommended. A bigger, large-scale web application will be better off if built with a Laravel framework. Authentication features With over 30,000 sites getting hacked every day, site safety is a big deal. As such, businesses and e-commerce entities will like the secure authentication and authorization that the Laravel framework offers. With Laravel, it’s quite easy to manage and control access to a site’s secure resources. CodeIgniter, on the other hand, doesn’t offer in-built authorization and authentication features. As such, it falls below the standards of modern site security. Is CodeIgniter Worth Learning? For years, the question of the usefulness of learning CodeIgniter has always come up. That&#8217;s why questions like “Is CodeIgniter worth learning in 2020?” and “Is CodeIgniter dead in 2019?” pop up in developer forums all the time. Based on our research, learning CodeIgniter is advisable — especially if you’re a beginner. It’s easier to master than most PHP web frameworks, which simplifies the learning curve. But, in the grand scheme of things, CodeIgniter has limited usefulness. Most companies and businesses nowadays ask for proficiency in frameworks like Symfony, Zend, and Laravel. Thus, learning something other than CodeIgniter may be better for job opportunities. If you want to break into web development faster, you can start with CodeIgniter. What you must not do is remain in the CodeIgniter niche for long — you must expand to other web frameworks to increase your relevance. What Is Better than Laravel? Laravel is considered one of the best frameworks for building web applications. It’s even one of the few competitors that’s given WordPress a run for its money. However, it has a few flaws that make it less of a better option than some competing options. WordPress, for instance, has some qualities that make it better than Laravel. To start with, WordPress offers better SEO performance for websites than Laravel. It’s also easier to set up and requires lesser upfront investment than Laravel-based projects. CodeIgniter is also better than Laravel in certain areas. For example, it has a lighter footprint, which makes for better stability. You might want to check out our article on Laravel vs WordPress for E-commerce. But, whether these features make the other frameworks better than Laravel depends on your project needs. Laravel itself is regarded as one of the best frameworks for building large-scale web solutions. So, you have to consider various factors when looking for a better option than Laravel. Which PHP Framework Is Fastest? The PHP framework pool is crowded with many options. Available PHP web frameworks include: Of these PHP aforementioned options, Phalcon remains the fastest PHP framework — only Laravel and a few others come close. Phalcon has incredible speed and stability because it’s built in C language. Sure, Phalcon has its own faults — complex documentation, requires knowledge of C, cannot use shared hosting, etc. But, if speed is your biggest consideration, Phalcon is your go-to choice. Is Laravel Good for Beginners? Laravel is a great option for building web applications, including online marketplaces, e-commerce shops, and many more. It’s also one of the more popular PHP languages among experienced developers. Whether it’s a great option for beginner programmers is another thing entirely. Laravel comes with a feature-rich structure which, although promotes greater functionality, increases the learning curve. The complexity of the Laravel framework is why it’s less popular among beginners. We recommend simpler PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter if you are just starting your web development journey. Conclusion Laravel and CodeIgniter are both great PHP frameworks to use in developing web applications for e-commerce purposes. Laravel is more difficult to learn at first, but it offers higher customization and more features for your site. CodeIgniter has a lower learning curve, but it’s only suitable for small-scale web solutions like small online shops.

Nowadays the usage of PHP frameworks has increased as they will boost the process of web development. Laravel vs CodeIgniter is the most famous difference between the PHP framework. While developing a web application, many people get confused between Laravel and CodeIgniter framework. The basic difference between Laravel and CodeIgniter is Laravel is relational object-oriented while CodeIgniter is object-oriented and Laravel comethat s with an authentication class whereas CodeIgniter doesn’t have a built-in authentication class. To select the best PHP framework you need to understand the differences between Laravel and CodeIgniter. What is Laravel? Laravel is an open-source and widely used PHP framework. The platform was intended for the development of web applications using MVC architectural patterns. Laravel is released under the MIT license. That’s why its source code is hosted on GitHub. Laravel is known for its extraordinary HTML Authentication, templating, server-side handling for routing, etc. Laravel is a web application framework with an expressive and elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details. Laravel framework is ideal as the server-side framework and it is the best framework to manage SaaS products. It is developed by Taylor Otwell in June 2011 and it is a free open-source PHP web framework as well as supports Model-View-Controller (MVC) patterns for application development. Laravel is a framework that supports database management system (DBMS) platforms like SQL Server, MySQL, etc. This framework is perfect for a large and complex website with some innovative features. What is CodeIgniter? CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework – a toolkit – for people who build websites using PHP.
