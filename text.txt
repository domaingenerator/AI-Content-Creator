 How do I add an Instagram widget on Blogger? Adding your Instagram, Facebook or Twitter widget to your Blogger blog is easy. Follow these steps to create your widget. Once you've created your widget, follow the appropriate steps below to add it to your website. Note: Depending on your theme, you can place your widget in a few areas, i.e. sidebar-right-1, Cross-Column or even in footer-1, footer-2-1 or footer-2-2. For this demonstration we use the Simple theme. Other themes follow the same principle, some have more areas where the widget can be placed.¬†  Edit the Blogger Template Select Layout If you want to place your SnapWidget in the sidebar-right-1 area you will find it to be very narrow. You can change the width of the sidebar-right-1 area by going to Blogger Theme Designer and choose Adjust widths. You should also keep in mind the options of your widget when setting it up on your SnapWidget dashboard (no. of columns and width, etc.). Set the width to your desired width The preview will display the changes in the width in real time. Click on Apply to Blog and then go Back to Blogger. Select your area and click on Add a Gadget. Select the HTML/JavaScript in the pop-up window¬† Paste your SnapWidget snippet in the Content box.¬† Add a title and click on Save. You can also include the widget in the wider Cross-Column area.

Gadgets can also be dragged between different areas, e.g. move the gadget from sidebar-right-1 to Cross-Column ¬†(Note: it cannot be placed in the Header): Click on Save arrangement to save your layout. Your widget will now be displayed on your Blogger blog!  Changing the appearance of your widget by modifying the snippet content Note: Any changes you make to the snippet contents will be only applicable to this Blogger instance, anywhere else you display your widget will be as you have set up your widget on your SnapWidget dashboard. To separate the widget from any other part in the same area insert a &lt;hr /&gt; tag at the start of the snippet. To horizontally center the widget on the page you will have to encapsulate the widget in a &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; area. To do this include a &lt;div&gt; tag with a text-align: center style just after the newly included &lt;hr /&gt; tag and close the &lt;div&gt; area with a &lt;/div&gt; tag after the &lt;/iframe&gt; tag. If you would like to include a header for your widget you can include a header just after the &lt;div style=‚Äùtext-align:center‚Äù&gt; tag, e.g. &lt;h1&gt;Our Products&lt;/h1&gt;. Depending on the size of header you want you can use &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt;¬† Example of an inserted snippet with the &lt;hr&gt; ¬†tag, header, widget width set to 75% and the widget encapsulated in a &lt;div&gt; ¬†area.

Posted by Shari | Jul 2, 2017 | Deer, Tutorials | 25  It&#8217;s very easy to add an instagram feed to WordPress, there are a number of different plugins you can use, but Google Blogger is less flexible. ¬†However, lightwidget.com has a great, easy, fast and free way to add a beautiful instagram feed to your Blogger blog. ¬†¬†Note before you start:¬† if your blog is NOT set to a custom domain, eg. you have a blog at mydomain.blogspot.com, you WILL need to upgrade to the premium version of the plugin for it to show up. ¬†The fee for this is $10, and it is a one-time payment.¬† Also, at this point, July 2018, most viewers will be viewing your blog via secure connection (https:// vs. http://).¬† So in order to ensure that most viewers will be able to see your instagram widget, you should upgrade to the pro widget for $10 to ensure maximum compatibility.¬† Please keep in mind I am not an affiliate or reseller for Lightwidget, I simply am a blogger who has found a product that seems to work well.¬† We are not responsible for changes in Lightwidget&#8217;s payment plan or compatibility.¬† You can follow the step by step tutorial below, or watch my video above! ¬† To start, go to www.lightwidget.com. Step 1: Click on the green Log in with Instagram box, and log into your instagram account. ¬†You will need to click to allow Lightwidget access to your instagram. ¬†Don&#8217;t worry, this is fine, it won&#8217;t autopost or affect your instagram feed. Step 2: You will be redirected back to Lightwidget. ¬†Now you can choose the appearance settings for your widget. ¬†You can also filter photos by hashtag if you wish. ¬†To show your instagram feed as a full grid across the bottom of your blog, copy the settings in this screenshot. ¬†If you want to just use the widget on your blog sidebar, 3 columns and 3 rows should work. ¬†The widget will auto-fit to the width of your sidebar. ¬†You can also choose an image hover effect if you wish. ¬†If you want more white space between your photos, set the padding to around 5px. Step 3: If you want all of your photos to be cropped into a square, click the Square Crops box. Step 4: Now just click the gray Get Code! button Step 5: Your widget is ready, yay! ¬†Now just click the green Copy to Clipboard button. ¬†This will copy the widget code to your computer. Step 6: Now, log into your Blogger blog. ¬†On the Layout tab (select from the list on the left), scroll down to the footer (if you want the widget to appear in the footer). ¬†Click on the Add a Gadget link. ¬†This will open a popup window, select HTML/Javascript. ¬†Now paste the code you copied in Step 5 into the window. ¬†Click the orange Save button. ¬†If you prefer to add your widget to the sidebar, follow the same steps but add into the Sidebar, not Footer area. ¬†Voila! ¬†When you save your changes, the instagram feed will appear in your blog footer. ¬†You do not need to update, photos will be added as you add them to instagram. ¬†Note: ¬†if your blog is NOT set to a custom domain, eg. you have a blog at mydomain.blogspot.com, you WILL need to upgrade to the premium version of the plugin. ¬†The fee for this is $10, and it is a one-time payment. ¬†Enjoy, and feel free to post any questions below!

Misleading. Hi there that&#8217;s a good point, I&#8217;m definitely not an affiliate and I don&#8217;t get a commission or anything from Lightwidget, it just seems to be the best Blogger widget to show Instagram feeds that I have found. I added a note to the top of the post as well about the fee if you&#8217;re not on a custom domain thanks for reading! I definitely saw the $10 fee underneath your picture up there, right at the beginning of the demonstration and i don&#8217;t know why Ellis is talking about misleading? Thank you for reading Brigitte! Yes, I&#8217;ve tried to highlight that since this tutorial was made most blogs are now appearing at https:// so unfortunately one does need to purchase the full widget for it to work on all domains, but still I think $10 is a pretty reasonable one time fee. Thank you again for stopping by! Same! it was really misleading. I was so excited to check thst you only need to pay in the end. https://awomansmodedevie.blogspot.com/ Hi guys yes I have moved the info about possibly having to pay to the beginning of the tutorial so users will know that dependent on how their blogger domain is set up, they may need to purchase the pro version, thank you for reading! Hi guys thanks so much for reading, I have added text to the beginning of the tutorial that indicates that you MAY have to pay for the premium version dependent on how your domain is set up in Blogger, hopefully that will eliminate any confusion. Thank you!! This was an amazing tutorial &#8211; thank you! Thanks so much for reading Kris I really appreciate it!!! Thank you so much for reading I really appreciate it! Excellent site. Plenty of useful info here. I&#8217;m sending it to some buddies ans additionally sharing in delicious.And obviously, thanks on your effort! Thank you Bibit that is much appreciated! Thank you for this- both the video and the step by step for those of us who like to read along. This was exactly what I was looking for and so easy. I ended up needing the upgrade but am sure it will be worth it. Off to explore the rest of your site- it is so visually appealing and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s so much more I can learn! I&#8217;m so glad! Thank you so much for reading I really appreciate it! Very helpful tutorial. I paid for it but it&#8217;s not updating on my blog. Is it an immediate purchase? Nevermind disregard my prior comment! I am so sorry, but I just need to confirm something&#8230; I can&#8217;t see the widget myself when I click on&#8221;view my blog&#8221; but I can see it from a third party. Is that normal? Thanks! Hey Taylor I think this is most likely because you are viewing both http and https. Https view is not available with the free widget so I would assume when you see the widget, you are viewing in http and when you can&#8217;t see it you are viewing in https. I couldn&#8217;t say 100% but this is my guess, if the $10 is not much to you it might be worth it to purchase the premium plugin in case this is the issue, that would be my best guess! However I will let you know that I can see the scrolling widget just fine when I went to your blog link, so it might be that it just doesn&#8217;t show up in preview mode. üôÇ You are the Best!!! Donna that&#8217;s awesome!!! And I&#8217;m so glad to hear from you and I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re still blogging! I recently painted our condo and I&#8217;d like to think I found the perfect gray! Mwah!!! hi i just tried this out but the widget in my footer says, I have to upgrade my widget but as mentioned in your blog my blogger domain should be a custom domain. I have a custom domain then why should I still pay 10 dollars? help please thanks. Hi Amy! Yes, I have posted an update at the top, as of July 2018 most domain registrars are now supporting https:// (or SSL certificates) so if your domain appears at https://yourdomain.com, you will want to purchase the upgrade for maximum compatibility. I&#8217;m not an affiliate or reseller I just like to help people find things that work for them so I&#8217;m not associated with Lightwidget in any way, but the $10 is a one-time fee, a lot of plugins make you pay a subscription fee but this is one time only so it might be worth it ensure maximum compatibility, totally down to you! Thank you so much for reading! I thank you so much. This really works very well. I came across your site and is very informative. Thank you again! Thank you so much for taking the time to make this tutorial! So very kind of you! Thank you for reading, Michelle! I&#8217;m so glad it was helpful! Now that most blogs are served over https:// you do need to pay for the upgraded version but still, it&#8217;s really the best and easiest way to show your instagram feed on Blogger!

In this Instagram for bloggers guide, we‚Äôll show you how to boost your blog readership and build a strong social media presence. For someone that&#8217;s just started a blog, finding the perfect method to grow your blog&#8217;s traffic can be tricky. But, don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s where social media comes in. Social media platforms like Instagram are a great way to promote your blog. To get the results you&#8217;re looking for though, you need to do it right. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve put together this guide to help you promote your blog on Instagram. We&#8217;ll show you how to use Instagram as a blogging platform, how to attract and find readers, how to embed your Instagram feed on your WordPress blog for maximum engagement, and much more. So without further ado, let&#8217;s begin. In This Guide: Benefits of Instagram for Bloggers There are a lot of benefits to promoting a blog on Instagram. If used the right way, Instagram can be the best place to grow your followers and readers all in one place. It has over 1 billion daily active users, which means that you have a lot of opportunities to get your brand out there. Instagram is a platform where people crave engaging visual content. And sharing engaging content on Instagram can do wonders for your brand. It can help you: Now that you know the benefits of using Instagram, let&#8217;s take a look at some tips to help you find success on the platform. Pick a Good Username Picking a good username for your Instagram account is very important. It grabs users&#8217; attention and helps them remember your brand. If you already have a blog name, you should stick to that to be consistent across all platforms. Choosing the same Instagram username as your blog name will also help your current readers find you on the platform easily. Here&#8217;s an example of the blog Christie At Home, using the same name for their Instagram username. If you don&#8217;t have a blog name yet and need help picking out the right one, then check out our free Domain Name Generator tool. It will generate thousands of blog name ideas for you, and all you have to do is enter your desired keyword. This tool will also help you get your desired domain name for free with Bluehost. Now that you have picked a professional and catchy username for your Instagram account, let&#8217;s move on to the next tip. Stick to Your Niche Before you start your Instagram journey, you need to pick a niche. A niche will help you decide what type of content to post on Instagram. The niche of your Instagram blog should be the same as the blog you want to promote. If you&#8217;re a fashion blogger, then you shouldn&#8217;t be posting or writing about finance. You&#8217;ll just end up confusing your readers and that will make it harder for you to gain Instagram followers. If you haven&#8217;t decided on the niche yet, then you should spend your time wisely deciding on the niche you&#8217;re going to pick. Because once you&#8217;ve chosen your niche, you&#8217;ll have to stick to it in the long run.&nbsp; Check out our guide on finding a profitable niche for more tips. Make Use of Your Instagram Bio You&#8217;d be surprised how effective that tiny bio space on your Instagram account can be. It can help you increase your blog&#8217;s traffic and readers if you use it effectively.&nbsp; Your Instagram bio acts like an elevator pitch; you have a 150 character limit to convince your audience to stay and follow your page.&nbsp; You can fill your Instagram bio with text, emojis, hashtags, and mentions. You should also place a link to your blog in your bio, this will help your audience quickly navigate to your blog. Keep in mind that you cannot post the link anywhere else, not even in your posts. If you need inspiration, you can also check out other bloggers in your niche and see how they have structured their bio. This will give you a good idea of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. For example, here&#8217;s a great Instagram bio from the blog Take Me Fishing: It describes what the blog is about and it also has relevant hashtags, emojis to grab attention, and it uses a Linktree link. Linktree is a tool that lets you link to multiple places on the web, like your website, your latest blog post, your newsletter signup form, and more, all from just 1 link. You can also follow this tutorial to create a link in bio page in WordPress. It&#8217;s a great Linktree alternative that gives you more customization options. Share Your Blog Posts on Instagram Sharing your blog posts on Instagram is the best way to get more traffic to your blog. You can leverage Instagram&#8217;s massive user base and influence them to click through to your blog by posting engaging visual content. However, sharing your blog posts on Instagram may sound like a simple task, but it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than that. If you want to grab your audience&#8217;s attention then you need to use: Take a look at post from WPBeginner&#8217;s Instagram as an example: They use high-quality images to promote their latest blog posts. Don&#8217;t worry, you don‚Äôt need to be an expert graphic designer to make visually appealing images like WPBeginner or any other big brand. You can use a free tool like Canva to make high-quality images for your Instagram blog. You can also use their pre-made templates to make images like the one below in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; As for how to write captivating captions, here are some things to keep in mind: Now let&#8217;s talk about using hashtags. Use Relevant Hashtags Using the right hashtags can have a great impact on your Instagram posts&#8217; reach.&nbsp; Hashtags are a great discovery tool for Instagram users; they allow people to easily find content relevant to their interests. If you use hashtags that are popular in your niche, you can attract more followers and readers to your blog. A great way to find hashtags is to follow bloggers in your niche to see what hashtags they are using. For example, if you have a food blog, you can see that fellow food bloggers on Instagram use hashtags like #EasyRecipe, #FamilyDinners, #InstagramFood, #RecipeIdeas, and more. Before adding hashtags to your posts, you should check the usage of those hashtags. If the hashtag has under 1000 posts, it&#8217;s unlikely that people are searching for those hashtags. You&#8217;re better off using popular but relevant hashtags since they attract a big crowd. Simply search for hashtags on Instagram to find out how popular they are: You could also do a little bit of research and see what keywords your potential followers are using to find content. To make things easy for yourself, you can use Tailwind. Tailwind has an Instagram Hashtag Finder tool to help you find relevant hashtags in your niche. The great thing about Instagram is that it allows users to follow hashtags of their choice. This means that if you are using relevant hashtags, your posts will show up in your target audience&#8217;s feed even if they aren&#8217;t following you. Instagram only allows you to use 30 hashtags in a single post. This means that you need to make sure that you&#8217;re using the right hashtags to attract the right audience, or you will be losing valuable space in your post&#8217;s description.&nbsp; Use CTAs in Your Posts Have you ever noticed text online saying &#8220;click here&#8221; or &#8220;download this exclusive content now,&#8221; words that ask you to take an action? These are called calls-to-action or CTAs for short. You need to add CTAs to your Instagram posts if you want users to take an action like visiting your site or reading your latest blog post. We&#8217;ve already discussed that Instagram doesn&#8217;t allow users to place clickable links in their Instagram posts. But you can still add the URL to help your audience navigate through to your blog. It may not be clickable, but it will work just as good if your captions are captivating. Take a look below at how WPBeginner uses CTAs and URL texts in their Instagram posts: Alternatively, you can add a CTA in your caption that asks users to click on the link in your bio. You can also include CTAs to increase engagement on your Instagram posts. It&#8217;s a known fact that all social media platforms reward posts that get high engagement like comments, likes, and shares. So, CTAs can encourage your audience to engage with your Instagram posts too. You can ask your followers to interact with your post by asking a question, by asking them to share an experience, or by simply asking them to like or share the post. Embed Your Instagram Feed On Your Blog You might be wondering, what&#8217;s the point of having an Instagram feed on your WordPress blog?&nbsp; Embedding an Instagram feed on your site can help you generate more engagement on your blog and on your Instagram posts. As we have discussed above, having a high engagement rate makes your Instagram posts more visible. And having more visibility means that there are chances of getting more followers.&nbsp; Plus, you can introduce your Instagram account to your blog readers, who might not have been aware of it before. Having an Instagram feed on your blog is the best way to accelerate your Instagram growth. We recommend using Instagram Feed Pro by Smash Balloon to display customizable Instagram feeds on your WordPress blog. Here&#8217;s what an Instagram feed could look like on your blog: You can read our step by step guide on how to add an Instagram widget to your blog for more details. Be Consistent With Your Posting Schedule To make social media work for your blog or your online business, you need to make a serious effort to be consistent.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no point in feeling all inspired and motivated now and posting content every day, to only drop out of using Instagram a few weeks later.&nbsp; Instagram users thrive on consistency; if you post once a day, your followers will expect you to post content every day. But as soon as you break that consistency, you will start losing followers. By having a consistent posting schedule, you can get more views, engagement, and followers on your Instagram. A great way to keep a consistent posting schedule is to create a social media calendar on Excel, Google Docs, or Google Calendar. Take a look at the example below: You can also use a scheduling tool like Buffer to automate your posting schedule. This helps you schedule your post in advance and saves valuable time. Connect With Your Audience You need to build a strong connection with your followers if you want them to stay around for the long run.&nbsp; The best way to connect to your audience is to be yourself. You&#8217;ve probably heard this phrase get thrown around a lot, but truth be told, this is what helps people easily connect with you and your brand. People love bloggers that share their stories and tips from a personal space. Remember, everything that you post is for your readers. Write your posts as though you are talking to one of your friends, and this will resonate with your audience, especially if you&#8217;re solving their problems. Don&#8217;t forget to talk to your followers in the comment section to further build your relationship with them. Make Use of Instagram Stories One of the best ways to promote your blog and gain followers is through Instagram Stories. Instagram Stories&#8217; popularity isn&#8217;t going down anytime soon, as 70% of Instagram users watch Instagram Stories every day. The biggest benefit of using Instagram Stories to promote your blog is that you can post a direct link to your blog, this is something you can&#8217;t do on your regular Instagram posts. Unfortunately, you need at least 10,000 followers to unlock this feature. Until you reach that milestone, using Instagram Stories are also a great way to keep your followers hooked because it&#8217;s engaging and visually appealing. Plus, you can also reach an all-new fan base that will help your blog grow! Pro Tip: Spread out the information in more than one story frame. If you put all of the information in one slide, chances are that your viewers will only see it for a second or two and then tap to the next story. If you spread out the information to 3 or 4 slides using engaging visuals, you will have an opportunity to capture their attention as they tap along with your Story. Here is an example: You can easily create engaging Instagram Stories using Instagram Story templates from Canva. Follow Other Bloggers and Engage With Their Content Posting engaging and likable content is one great way to get noticed and to grow your Instagram followers. Another effective way is to actively follow, like, and comment on content shared by other influential bloggers in your niche. This is a great way to become more visible in the blogging community. Once you get enough attention, your peers might decide to feature you in their post or reach out to you for a collaboration. You can significantly increase your blog‚Äôs visibility by collaborating with other bloggers and businesses. If you want to collaborate with your fellow bloggers but don&#8217;t know where to start, follow the tips below:&nbsp; Networking on Instagram is a great way to reach new audiences. Run Instagram Giveaways Running Instagram giveaways is another great way to grow your Instagram followers and promote your blog.

You&#x27;re fighting against business both large and small, competing for the limited attention of website visitors and future customers. People have a 2.5 second attention span, and even shorter for new website visitors. What will it take to get your online business new customers?  Some businesses first try a do-it-yourself (DIY) Instagram Feed or have a ‚Äútechie‚Äù that claims he/she can build an Instagram Feed in &#x27;no time&#x27;. Others attempt to find open source Instagram Feed apps, or foreign companies that allegedly offer Instagram Feed apps at rock-bottom prices. But actually, these routes are expensive and super time consuming. While the Instagram Feed could look okay when you look at it, mobile visitors, or visitors on different browsers, might see an unresponsive, unattractive, and unhelpful Instagram Feed. Worse still, they might not see it at all. It takes lots of time to customize and update the Instagram Feed, which will result in more complications. Additionally, if you haven&#x27;t built a strong security system, your business could be prone to hacking and other security vulnerabilities. More traffic on your site can also lead to challenges with the Instagram Feed, as more visitors on your site can increase loading times.

Or are you wondering what the differences are between the different profiles Instagram offers? No problem, I&#8217;ve got you covered. In this post, I&#8217;ll explain the differences between Instagram&#8217;s different profiles. And I&#8217;ll show you how to convert your personal IG profile into a business profile &#8211; step-by-step. Let&#8217;s get started: What‚Äôs the difference between personal and professionalaccounts? On the surface, a business and personalaccount on Instagram seems pretty similar. They‚Äôre both free to use, anyone can applyfor them, and they‚Äôre great for sharing content online. However, there are some big differencesbetween personal and professional options that are worth noting. For instance,you need a business account if you want to access things like InstagramInsights (for marketing intel), Instagram Ads, and more. A business account is the only way you canplace contact details on your profile too. Before Business profiles arrived onInstagram, brands had to try and pack a tiny Insta bio full of information tocapture their target audience. Now, companies can access a beefed up version ofthe personal profile instead. While technically you could run yourInstagram account with a personal profile, why limit yourself to fewerfeatures? Business profiles vs creator profiles If you‚Äôre tuned into all things Instagram,then you‚Äôll know that a Business profile isn‚Äôt your only option outside of apersonal account anymore. Recently, Instagram also introduced Creator profiles. Creator accounts give you access to various exclusive features and more in-depth analytics. Unfortunately, if you want to automatically publish posts from a third-party social scheduling tool, you can‚Äôt do that with a Creator account. Only business accounts offer auto-publishing and scheduling. With a creator account, you would need toset up a reminder system where you got an email or notification when it wastime to publish instead. On the plus side, you do get exclusive accessto the Instagram creator studio, follow/unfollow metrics, and engagement stats.You can also filter your direct messages inbox, to make conversations withclients easier, and tag products directly from brands in your posts. The benefits of having a professional account on Instagram Some people can feel a little hesitantabout switching from a personal profile to a business account on Instagram.Change is scary. However, the benefits of upgrading aredifficult to ignore. With a business profile you can: 1.&nbsp;Access Instagram insights Probably the main reason that people move from a personal account to a business account, is that business accounts offer more insight into your users. If you‚Äôre using a personal account, you don‚Äôt have any data on how well your Stories and Instagram posts are doing. When you switch to a business profile, youget Instagram‚Äôs special selection of analytics tools. Creator profiles can evendive deeper into things like engagement and follow/unfollow numbers. The moreyou know about your audience, and which content they love, the easier it is toenhance your following on Instagram. 2.&nbsp;Run ads on Instagram The potential reach of advertising on Instagram is 879 million. While posting organically on Instagram canearn you a lot of attention, if you know your target audience, you canaccomplish much more with ads. Creating promotions with Instagram‚Äôs adplatform will help you to reach the right customers inside of the platform sothat you can ramp up your sales potential. Instagram can also create audiencesfor you, or you can select exactly who you want to reach. When you need a little boost to get you inthe right place on Instagram, ads are a great feature ‚Äì however they‚Äôre onlyavailable for business profile users. 3.&nbsp;Enhance your Instagram profile Another massive benefit of using a business account on Instagram, rather than just a personal account, is that you can make your profile stand out. You get a few extra features to play with on a business account, including contact buttons that offer instant access to your company. The CTA buttons at the top of your businessprofile will ensures that your customers can call, email, or even find directionsto your business. Additionally, Creator accounts come with the option to filterthrough messages so that they can respond to the right leads as quickly aspossible. 4.&nbsp;Add links to your Instagram stories Instagram limits users to a single bio link and doesn&#8217;t allow clickable links within image descriptions.

Then follow these steps: Step 1: In the page editor, click the top-right code icon Step 2: Click on the HTML/code icon in the top right corner of the text editor and paste the provided code.&nbsp; Finally, click &#8216;Save&#8217;, and the Instagram feed will appear on the selected page. &nbsp;Add an Instagram feed to Shopify full tutorial. Embed Instagram Feed on other web platforms Here are additional tutorials to help you display the Instagram photos on other web platforms: Other Options to Embed Instagram Feed for Free Here are 2 free options on how to add your Instagram feed in WordPress or any other web platform: 1. Instagram&#8217;s official embedding option Instagram offers an easy embed feature that lets you add an Instagram post on WordPress. Check the full Instagram&#8217;s&nbsp;official embedding guide. Although these are simple ways to embed your Instagram feed, they come with many limitations: 2. 3rd-party Instagram feed plugins for WordPress or any website EmbedFeed is not the only platform that provides a free version for embedding Instagram feeds. There are plenty of other tools that can help you do a similar task. Before using the final tool, we suggest checking the&nbsp;WordPress plugin directory&nbsp;or the Shopify apps store&nbsp;for relevant apps like Smash Balloon that might provide similar functionality. Note: Instagram is continuously changing the API, and you will need a professional tool built by developers that have API access to the Instagram platform. In June 2020, Instagram stopped using the old API (&#8220;Basic Permission&#8221;) to display photos from personal Instagram accounts to widgets. This means that 3rd party apps that use the current API can no longer display pictures from your account if they don&#8217;t switch to the new API. You will need to convert your Instagram Personal account to Instagram Business Account or an Instagram Creator Account. EmbedSocial can provide this, and it is already compliant with the latest API changes. Do more: Embed your Instagram feed on a website like a Pro We explained how to use the free version of the EmbedFeed platform for embedding Instagram feeds on any website.

Benefits of adding Instagram feed on your website So,&nbsp;why should you display the Instagram feed on your website? From showing and keeping your Instagram users up to date with your new products to directly selling your inventory, Instagram and your content become a central point of your business success. Displaying an excellent Instagram feed of all super authentic photos created from your account will increase user engagement and time on site, turning visitors into followers. So, here are some of the main benefits of embedding Instagram feeds: From the list above, probably the most valuable benefit for e-Commerce brands is the ability to showcase user-generated content in social proof forms. This means that having the opportunity to auto-sync content produced by real people about their actual usage of a particular product is priceless proof that helps build trust in e-Commerce websites and drive prospective customers&#8217; purchasing decisions. Examples of Instagram Feeds on website Almost no website doesn&#8217;t display Instagram feeds, either creating an Instagram gallery of their Instagram posts or a user-generated content widget with posts from an Instagram hashtag that display their customers&#8217; photos. Here is an example of the Stranger Things Instagram feed: See more Instagram feeds examples to inspire and learn how others embed their Instagram photos or create entire social media feeds with other people&#8217;s posts that mention their brand.

Privacy Policy | Terms of use | Privacy Overview Online Business | How To How to Start an Instagram Blog in 8 Steps WRITTEN BY: Kathy Haan Published August 7, 2020 Kathy has over 21 years of experience in online business. She uses her knowledge in the online business world to deliver the best answers to your questions about blogging, podcasting, and online business. This article is part of a larger series on How to Make Money Blogging. If you‚Äôre wondering how to start an Instagram blog with no experience, you‚Äôll be happy to know it‚Äôs easy to start. Instagram blogging is microblogging because of the 2,200 character limit for captions vs no limit on traditional blogging platforms. Instagram bloggers with 15,000 engaged followers can make around $200 per sponsored post. Many people start a blog on Instagram with the intention to sell products out of the gate. If this is your goal, you can get started for free with Square Online. It has the easiest setup process, and you don‚Äôt pay a dime until you make a sale. This is perfect for Instagram bloggers who don‚Äôt have months to build a full-fledged ecommerce store. Get started for free today. Visit Square Online Here are the eight steps on how to start an Instagram blog: 1. Create an Instagram Account Creating an Instagram account is free and takes just a few minutes to do. The step that takes the longest is figuring out what you want your username to be. Keep in mind that unlike other social media platforms, you can change your username later on. However, many prefer to use their full name as a username so they build a personal brand. Get started with your Instagram account in just a few steps: Users can also sign up for Instagram from a desktop now. You may have more than one Instagram account. Some people choose to have an account for their personal brand as well as a company (such as an ecommerce store or podcast). 2. Choose a Niche for Your Instagram Blog When learning how to start an Instagram blog, the key to gaining consistent growth is to give your audience what they&#8217;ve come to expect. If you are a travel Instagram blogger and then post a sponsored ad for a recliner, you‚Äôre not only going to confuse followers but you might cause them to unsubscribe. By choosing a niche for your Instagram blog, you‚Äôre telling people who come to your blog exactly what kind of content they‚Äôll get going forward if they follow you. It‚Äôs important that you take careful consideration when choosing a niche. While you can change your focus later on, doing so can confuse your audience. Some Instagram bloggers start with a broad category such as a lifestyle blog before deciding on a narrower niche like travel or parenting. It‚Äôs also important to understand that many Instagram bloggers also eventually create a blog on a website, which doesn‚Äôt have any limits on the number of characters you can write. Travel Within a travel niche, you can get even more specific. Some Instagram blogs focus solely on domestic travel or on international travel. There are entire blogs dedicated to just Disney travel. Other travel niches include solo travel, plus size travel, family travel, and traveling with pets. There‚Äôs even a travel Instagramer who dedicates her account to camping in her living room thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Instagram travel bloggers find success monetizing through hosting travel tours. There are many bloggers who also teach others how to travel more, whether that‚Äôs by using travel rewards through credit cards or selling everything you own to travel. As a fellow travel blogger, I follow many travel bloggers on Instagram to get ideas for new places to visit. The Blonde Abroad is a popular travel Instagram blog. She also has a blog on her website, a YouTube channel, a private Facebook community, and hosts tours around the world. Lifestyle A lifestyle Instagram blog often features photos and posts of everyday activities, hobbies, or insights. These bloggers tend to stick with a few categories rather than posting anything and everything they enjoy. For example, a lifestyle blogger may post about family, travel, food, and money. Many lifestyle Instagram bloggers monetize their content through brand partnerships. These brand partnerships are often sponsored posts, where an Instagrammer gets paid to do a static Instagram post or Instagram story about a product. Sometimes, they do affiliate programs with different brands and earn a commission on any sales referrals. Rebeka Rpati is a lifestyle blogger who also has a blue verified check mark to her name. This is likely because she‚Äôs Miss Universe Hungary and a TV presenter. This lets other users know this is a legitimate account for this public figure. Food Food Instagram bloggers come in many niches as well. You‚Äôve got bloggers who talk about things like baking, grilling, sous vide, and candy. There are bloggers who are diet-specific such as keto, paleo, and gluten-free. Some bloggers also choose to showcase food found during their travels or only food of a specific location such as NYC food carts. Instagram food bloggers can monetize their blogs through brand partnerships, writing cookbooks, or creating their own kitchen gadgets. A sous vide blogger showing a recipe that uses sous vide might give a list of their favorite sous vide machines while using affiliate links. Pinch of Yum is a Minnesota-based couple who are not only food bloggers, but also host food photography workshops and run a food blogger membership site teaching others how to have their own food blog. Money Instagram money bloggers write about many different money-based topics. These topics include personal finance, credit cards, paying off debt, making money, investing, and even investment-specific niches like Forex or cryptocurrency. Money bloggers earn money through partnerships, sponsored posts, and affiliate links. Popular money bloggers have created their own tools like budget binders and planners. Online courses, coaching, consulting, and membership sites are also popular monetization strategies for money bloggers. Ramit Sethi is a personal finance blogger behind the NY Times Bestseller, &#8220;I Will Teach You to Be Rich.&#8221; 3. Create a Captivating Bio An Instagram bio is a little snippet of text below your picture within your Instagram profile. An Instagram profile is where users view your profile, photo, and all of the posts you‚Äôve created. It‚Äôs also where users go to follow you. This bio area is an opportunity to show everyone who you are, what you stand for, and who you serve within 150 characters. It‚Äôs a chance for you to make a good first impression, so you‚Äôll want to spend some time crafting a captivating bio. As an Instagram blogger, it‚Äôs important for you to give visitors to your profile a sneak peek at what they can expect if they follow you. Some users choose to give their contact information like an email address or a phone number‚Äîparticularly if they are a business or if want someone to get in touch about collaboration opportunities. Others prefer to share a quote, their location, and maybe even some hobbies. Whatever you choose to showcase in your bio, remember to tailor it to your niche and your desired audience. When you are very specific about who you are, you are more likely to attract people who are just like you and want to engage with your content. On my Instagram bio, it&#8217;s clear that I&#8217;m a travel blogger. Readers can expect to see travel photos, our homestead, and my family. 4. Take or Source Attractive Images Instagram is a visual platform where the photos you showcase matter more than the captions. Photos you share need to follow your brand identity design so that the style of your image is recognized as yours before a user checks to be sure it is. This aesthetic should remain consistent throughout your Instagram posts. This helps create a cohesive look to your profile. It‚Äôs important to note that you don‚Äôt have to always use your own images to post. There are many free stock photo websites to use such as Pexels and Pixabay. Many of these images don‚Äôt require attribution, but it‚Äôs best to double-check what the restrictions are on each photo. Each of these photos from Pexels has the same warm mood and would work well on the same Instagram feed. 5. Write Your Instagram Blog Posts An Instagram blog post is also known as a caption. Your captions can be no more than 2,200 characters. For this reason, many consider that using Instagram for blogging means that you‚Äôre microblogging compared to writing a full-fledged blog hosted on your own website. Your blog posts don‚Äôt necessarily have to be 2,200 words to tell a story. Many times captions that are short and thought-provoking do really well on Instagram. The most important lines in your captions are the first line and then your call to action line. The first line you write should grab a reader‚Äôs attention. Think of it as a one-liner‚Äîwhat‚Äôs going to stop someone from scrolling by your post in their news feed? This should be a relatively short line so they can read it without having to click ‚Äúmore‚Äù to view the rest of your caption. Give an intriguing statement, prompt an emotional response, or share an offer. Your last line should give a call to action (CTA). The CTA can be as simple as asking your followers to engage with you in the comment section. Or, your CTA might ask to tag a friend, check out the link in your bio for more information, or hit the follow button. A popular CTA is ‚Äúdouble tap if you agree,‚Äù referencing the act one performs to ‚Äúlike‚Äù your Instagram image. Another important element when creating your Instagram blog posts is to make sure you‚Äôre breaking up the text if you‚Äôre writing a lot. It is difficult to read a huge wall of text without natural line breaks. You want your content to be easy-to-digest. Instagram doesn‚Äôt make it easy to do this within the app, so many people write their draft in notes or a word processing document before copying and pasting it into the platform to preserve the formatting. 6. Use Relevant Hashtags to Boost Discoverability A hashtag is a word or phrase, preceded by a hash sign (#). These hashtags allow users to find messages about a given topic. For example, when entering the hashtag #travelinspo in the search field on Instagram, it shows travel photos. You can use hashtags on both static Instagram posts and Instagram stories. With static posts, you can use up to 30 hashtags. You may add up to 10 hashtags in a story. When using hashtags, even non-followers can find your content if they‚Äôre searching for that particular hashtag. This allows Instagram bloggers to reach new audiences and grow their following. To find relevant hashtags to use, many bloggers like the program Later.com. With it, you provide a hashtag you want to use and it will give you suggestions of similar hashtags, or hashtags commonly used with that hashtag. The program will let you know as soon as you‚Äôve hit your 30 hashtag limit for your caption. There are 48 million posts with the #travelblogger hashtag. Users can follow a hashtag to see these posts in their news feed without following each individual creator. 7. Geotag Your Posts To geotag a post, you‚Äôre simply adding a geographical location to tell others where a photo is taken. Some users prefer to be very detailed about where an image was taken, such as the exact name of a coffee shop. Others prefer to be more general, such as tagging Manhattan or even New York. Geotagging lets others see where you‚Äôre at. It also helps others find images from a particular location. A user can search Instagram by location to find others who‚Äôve been to a spot they‚Äôre researching. Including your location allows bloggers to grow their audience because Instagram users can search for location-based posts and stumble upon any post that has a geotag. If a user likes what you‚Äôve posted, you might gain a new follower‚Äîall because you‚Äôve tagged your location. This Instagram blogger has geotagged their location as Manarola, Le Cinque Terre, which is in Italy. 8. Interact With Other Instagram Users The entire point of using social media is to be social‚Äîthis involves interacting with other users on Instagram. You can like and comment on other users‚Äô posts, and you can follow them. When you interact with other users, they‚Äôre more likely to check out your profile and microblog. If they like what they see, there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll follow you back or at least leave a like or comment to return the favor. Use Instagram Stories One of the most popular features of Instagram is using Instagram Stories. A story acts like a slideshow that is only available for 24 hours on your Instagram Story feed, unless you choose to feature it. When you feature the Instagram Story it will remain on your profile in the Highlight section until you remove it. Within these Instagram stories, users can share images, videos, and text. Stories are much less curated than a static post that shows up in your Instagram feed and remain forever on your profile unless you choose to delete it. Many users choose to showcase behind-the-scenes footage of their daily lives on their stories. You can also create polls, share GIFs, and post a story for a select group of people to see. Bloggers can tag other users stories, and if they sell on Instagram, they can also tag a product. If you have more than 10,000 followers on Instagram, you can use a feature that allows a visitor to swipe up on the story. When a user swipes up on the content, it takes them to a URL of the story creators‚Äô choice. This is a great place to insert an affiliate link. Instagram stories let you see who viewed your story. Comment and Like Users‚Äô Posts When you engage with another user‚Äôs content, they‚Äôre more likely to return the favor. The comments that you make on another post should be thoughtful, more than an emoji, and show that you actually read their captions. You don‚Äôt have to write a book‚Äîa sentence or two is the perfect length. Follow Other Users One of the biggest faux pas on Instagram is the follow-unfollow method. This is following a user only with the intention of them following you back and unfollowing them once they do. It‚Äôs a pretty common practice on Instagram to grow your followers in this way, however many consider it tacky. Instagram has said they‚Äôre working on policies to prevent this practice from occurring. Your best strategy for growing your own followers‚Äô list is to authentically follow other users you want to follow. How to Monetize Your Instagram Blog There are many ways to make money on your Instagram blog. These monetization methods include being an affiliate for someone else‚Äôs products and services, creating sponsored posts, and selling your own products and services. While any links you add to the caption area of a post will not be clickable, you can add a link to your bio. Some people choose to create a free account with a website provider, like Square Online, and host a list of links there. This is useful if you talk about different links in each post you make. Otherwise, you can use linktr.ee, which is another popular place to list your URLs. As a blogger with an actual website, I prefer not to use linktr.ee because I want to get the page views rather than giving it to another service. I‚Äôve also seen instances where an update to the Instagram platform caused accounts using linktr.ee to temporarily shut down, so proceed with caution if using this method. An example of a landing page that an Instagram account links to specifically for Instagram rather than using linktr.ee, but it operates just the same. (Source: The SweetLife Company by April Beach) Use Affiliate Links An affiliate marketing program lets creators earn a commission for referring sales to a merchant. These commissions are usually one to 10% of a sale, but sometimes pay if there‚Äôs a lead or a click on a custom link instead. Leads and clicks typically pay less than $1 each. This is an attractive option for many Instagram bloggers because people usually talk about their favorite products and services anyway. They might as well get paid for it. Sometimes merchants and bloggers negotiate an incentive, like a 10% off coupon, for followers to use. This doesn‚Äôt usually eat into the commission an affiliate earns and instead comes out of the merchant‚Äôs marketing budget. Instagram bloggers can sign up for an account with rewardStyle, which uses the LiketoKnow.it app to make it easy for them to share products featured in posts. The best part about this is that the blogger receives a commission for sales made. An example of Instagram user @arrayoffaces using an affiliate code to promote a product. Create Sponsored Posts Instagram bloggers can create content for brands in exchange for free product, a discount, or money. What you earn for a post will depend on the number of followers and the engagement you receive. For example, a blogger with 15,000 engaged followers could earn around $200 for a post and $350 for a video. Instagram stories tend to pay less because they disappear after 24 hours. Learn more about setting your blog rates. You can earn money even if you don‚Äôt have a lot of followers because brands tend to care more about engagement than vanity metrics. The reason for this is because it‚Äôs easy to artificially inflate the number of followers and likes you get by purchasing these. However, comments are much harder to artificially create. When you have an engaged audience, they‚Äôre more likely to trust you and listen to your recommendations. An example of a sponsored post by user @kkateli Sell Your Own Products &amp; Services Creating your own products and services allows you to control not only the features, but also the production and quality of your offerings. You can create products like supplements, physical books, e-books, apparel, and kitchen gadgets. Services you can offer include design, consulting, and coaching‚Äîeach of these tend to offer higher profit margins since you don‚Äôt need to create any physical goods. If you don‚Äôt have an ecommerce website but have a few products you want to sell, consider using Square Online. This allows you to quickly create an online store using products featured in your Instagram posts‚Äîeven past posts you‚Äôve made. It takes just three quick steps to get started and you don‚Äôt pay anything until you make a sale. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on How to Start an Instagram Blog This section includes the most frequently asked questions about how to start an Instagram blog. How successful are Instagram bloggers? There are Instagram bloggers who post regularly and have less than 100 followers and make nothing. You‚Äôve also got bloggers who have millions of followers and also make millions of dollars. Your success will depend not only on how you measure success, but also your talent, resources, and commitment to blogging on Instagram. How many followers do I need to be considered an influencer? The number of followers you have on Instagram doesn‚Äôt determine if you‚Äôre an influencer. In fact, you can have five followers on Instagram. For example, if you make a post about a new tea mug to your five followers and they go buy that tea mug based on your recommendation, you have officially influenced that purchase. How many followers do I need to get verified on Instagram? The number of followers doesn‚Äôt matter when it comes to Instagram verification. Verification goes to accounts that are noteworthy, such as those who are often imitated. These include celebrities, athletes, and politicians. You can apply for verification and Instagram will conduct a review of your notable accomplishments using independent sources like news channels and magazines. Bottom Line No matter the reasoning behind wanting to learn how to start an Instagram blog, you can get started very quickly. It takes just a few minutes to create your account, and then you‚Äôre ready to source images and create your first blog post. The benefits of using Instagram as a blog include getting to create captivating content very quickly without spending money, building a following, and potentially even making money from it.

How to Embed Your Instagram Feed On Your Website If you use social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, you may already know they go a long way in helping you connect with your customers in a direct and personal way. But clients and customers might not be well acquainted with your social presence. Therefore, the smart way to build a massive online following is to embed Instagram feeds and other social media profiles to your website. In this article, we will explore how you can embed your Instagram feeds directly into your website. If you want to add your Instagram feed in a sidebar, your home page, your footer, or a blog post (like this), then keep on reading! Curator.io is an easy-to-customize aggregator that lets you pull from over a dozen sources. If you'd like to give Curator.io's free forever plan a spin sign up today. What types of Instagram feeds can you embed? Instagram offers a lot of different types of posts. It's important to take a step back and think about what you want to aggregate. Do you just want to embed your Instagram feed? Or do you want to embed photos and videos that other users post about your business? You can embed all of these types of content: Embedded feed examples Here's an example of an embedded feed using Curator's free plan. You'll see the "Powered by Curator" link at the bottom. Compared to our competitors, we have the least noticeable branding on the free plan, and that link can be removed on any paid plan. And here's another example‚Äîthis time using a paid plan to remove the "Powered By" link. This is a great example of embedding an Instagram feed in order to display user generated content and encourage more customers to post their photos. How to embed your Instagram feed for free Embedding your Instagram feed is different than embedding an individual post. You need to connect your Instagram account to an aggregator, choose your feed layout, and then copy and paste the HTML code where you want the feed to appear in your website. A social media aggregator is an easy-to-use app that pulls in your social media content and gives you the tools you need to organize and stylize that content. Then, you simply paste the HTML code in the footer of your website, your home page, or wherever you want your Instagram feed to appear. Here's how to embed your Instagram feed for free: Let's review these steps in more detail. Step 1: Sign up for a social media aggregator with a free plan The first step is to sign up for a social media aggregator that offers a free plan. This is important because... Step 2. Create a new feed and choose whether or not posts should be automatically approved Now it's time to create a feed and give it a name. You can give it a simple name like "Instagram Feed" or "My Instagram Posts" or "Instagram Posts from Branded Hashtag." You also need to choose the default post status. Do you want everything to be automatically approved to show up on your site? Or do you want to have to greenlight each image? In the settings of your feed, you have two options: Step 3: Connect your Instagram account and choose the type of posts When you add an Instagram feed to your website, you have a lot of options for the type of content you want to aggregate. This is because Instagram has the highest amount of post types of any social media platform. With Curator, you can aggregate all of these different types of content: (You can even add social media content from other platforms, but we'll save that for another post!) You can choose to curate an Instagram feed made up of your Instagram business account, or a few different hashtags. For this tutorial, we'll go with an Instagram business account. You just sync in via Facebook and select the associated Instagram business account you want to use. Curator.io is an easy-to-customize aggregator that lets you pull from over a dozen sources.

You can remove the images that you don't want showing up in the feed you'll embed on your website. You can also update the settings for automatic curation if you want to change them. If you choose automatic approval, then you need to delete the posts that you don't want to show up. If you choose that approval is required, then you need to approve the posts you do want to show up. If you're set to "Needs approval" and you don't give some posts a green checkmark, then no posts will be able to be added to your website. Step 5: Design your feed The next step is to update the design of your feed. You can choose from our pre-set designs that include different ways of portraying the captions. Some designs let you hover over the image to see the captions, while others put the caption below or next to the image. If you want, you can even upload your own custom posts to your feed. Yup, these are images that you didn't upload on Instagram. You might want to do this if you're promoting a product or a freebie offer. Step 6: Copy the HTML code into your site Finally, it's time to embed the HTML code into your website. Just hit "Get code" and then "Copy to clipboard." Then you can paste it wherever you want: a section of your home page, a blog post, a landing page, or even the sidebar of your blog post. Let's go ahead and add it to the sidebar. To do embed the Instagram feed HTML code into Wordpress (for free!), we just need to drag and drop a Custom HTML widget over. Next we paste the HTML code from Curator.io over to the Custom HTML content box. There's no need to add a title, unless you want to. You could write something like, "The latest Instagram posts" or anything creative you can think of. Step 7. Check out how the feed looks in your website and make any adjustments And it's done! Here's what the feed looks like in the sidebar of a blog. This style puts the caption right below the image and it moves through the posts in an automated slider. It's a very engaging and eye-catching addition to your blog! But of course, if you prefer a simpler look, you can create a grid style where the captions don't show unless you hover over them, like this example feed: Step 8. Continue to moderate the Instagram content on your website You'll want to continue checking your website to make sure that only the best content is showing up. Moderate your website based on the approval setting you choose Curator.io is an easy-to-customize aggregator that lets you pull from over a dozen sources.

The 3 main options for embedding Instagram content in your site While the above is the simplest and easiest way to embed Instagram feeds on your website, there are other ways to do this too. Maybe you want to embed individual posts, or try other methods for feed embeds, or write your own custom code to create a feed. Method 1: Adding individual posts Pros: Cons: You may want to embed individual posts to your website. While this is easy to do, it can be cumbersome in the long run, because you have to keep on embedding to particular posts. In other words, if you would like this embed to display the most recent post, then you‚Äôd need to move back and edit your embed whenever you create a new Instagram post. For most people, who post on a daily basis, this would be a lot of trouble for not much value. Embedding an individual post is easy. Simply navigate underneath the post, and you will notice a [‚Ä¶] button. Proceed to click this button, and you will see several options, including embed. Tap embed. Copy the code that will appear. Next, paste it in your WordPress blog post, and it will automatically convert into an embed. You are done! The process is that simple. You may also add extra parameters such as specifying the width of the post, hiding the captions of the post and display just the image with Instagram‚Äôs frame trappings. Method 2: Social media aggregators Instagram does not offer a single box plugin to help you display content from your account. Therefore, to embed your Instagram feeds or entire Instagram profile, you will need to use third-party plugins. Instagram feed plugins work by allowing you to enter your Instagram account ID and then displaying a gallery of your recent posts. This includes your latest photos, a page, and the sidebar area of your website. Example: Curator.io Curator.io is one of the most popular Instagram feed embed tools. Most people like it because it covers several social networks all at once. Curator.io works with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Hashtag feeds, and more. You don't have to do numerous feeds either. Curator.io will let you aggregate all of the different sources into a single embedded feed. In other words, you do not need to have your RSS feeds, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram feeds, and others in different locations and format. You use a single central feed instead. Using a single feed is more convenient for you and your site visitors. Otherwise, you're looking at a cluttered site that's not pleasant for anyone. Curator.io offers free versions as well as paid versions. Using the free version, you can still access content from various social media platforms all at once and even filter by hashtag. However, the advantage of the paid version is that get more customization options, refined filtering and many other features you will find useful. You can start with the free version and once you see the benefits, you'll likely want to upgrade for even more engagement with your Instagram feed and other social feeds.

Example: SnapWidget SnipWidget isn't just a single widget, but a variety of widgets you may consider to embed posts in several ways. Some of its unique features include: As you can see, there are several options and features to choose from. Example: EmbedSocial EmbedSocial is also a series of plugins. Perhaps you may have come across some of them, such as EmbedStories, EmbedFeed, EmbedAlbum and EmbedReviews. With the free version, you can access, aggregate and create up to ten Instagram albums or Facebook albums. However, if you are looking to increase the number of data sources or turn your gallery into a shop, then you may consider a premium version. Example: Tagembed With Tagembed, you can add content from Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, and other channels. You can also embed not only content from profiles but also from hashtags. This is great if you have a branded hashtag for user generated content or if you have a wedding hashtag. With Curator, you can also embed content from hashtags, not just profiles. Method 3: Custom code If you are tech savvy and you can code, you may also consider writing a plugin code yourself. You will need to apply for a token for authentication allowing you to access the Insta API (and this where things get tricky for most programmers). You can always add your embed code to your website even if it was built with a website builder. For non-tech savvy users, it should still be easy to know how to build your own website using the platform. To begin with, following several privacy breaches, Instagram is in the process of changing their API. There is an accelerated plan to drop their API in favor of Facebook Graph API. The potential outcome you should expect from this move is getting rid of ID which enabled you to aggregate photos from other users. One issue with creating your own plugin is you'll also be required to update it yourself as Instagram makes changes. With every change, your Instagram feed will become unavailable until you're able to update the code. Doing this and applying again could take days or weeks, which leaves site visitors thinking your site is incomplete. If you don't want to do it yourself, you can hire someone to create an Instagram embed plugin for you. This works well for custom websites or when you need a highly customized look and feel for your embedded Instagram feed. If you choose&nbsp;custom software development, it will help meet your concerns and key needs. How to embed your Instagram feed on a WordPress website Curator is an excellent WordPress Instagram widget. When embedding your Instagram content in your WordPress site, the steps are mostly the same as outlined above. The only main difference is that when it comes to actually installing the feed you have two options: 1) copy the HTML code or 2) use Curator's WordPress plugin so that you can copy and paste short code instead. Below, we'll review these steps in more detail. Step 1. Choose a social media aggregator tool The first step is to choose a social media aggregator. Depending on your needs, the platform should be free or affordable. You need a social media aggregator so that you can embed your entire feed instead of copying and pasting code for every post. Step 2. Create a new feed and set the approval style Next, create your first feed, give it a name and choose your approval style. We recommend choosing "Approved" if it's your content and "Needs approval" if you're aggregating content from event attendees, customers, or influencers. This way, you can approve everything and there won't be any surprises showing up on your website. Step 3. Select the type of Instagram content you want to aggregate Next, choose Instagram as your feed source and choose the type of Instagram posts. For most WordPress websites, people choose their Instagram Business Account and aggregate all of the content from their profile. Step 4. Approve or remove posts The next step will be to approve or deny posts, based on your approval setting. If you're manually approving, make sure to approve what you want showing up. If you're allowing your content to be automatically approved, then simply delete anything you want to remove from your WordPress website.  Step 5. Customize the look of your Instagram feed Now it's time to stylize your Instagram WordPress feed. Choose the theme you'd like. There are several different themes that work great with WordPress websites: Most people like to keep their Instagram feeds clean and simple and let the posts shine all on their own. However, you can add borders and backgrounds, and change the font color of the text and icons. For professional WordPress developers, a custom CSS section is available so you can add your own code. Step 6. Embed the feed in your WordPress website Now, you need to add the feed to your WordPress website. No plugin option: Just click "Publish Feed" and copy the HTML code into the clipboard. Paste it where you want the feed to go, such as in your footer or sidebar. With WordPress, all you have to do is add a custom HTML widget to your website and then copy the code into the box. With plugin option: Download the Curator plugin and upload it to your website. Or go to the plugins section of your WordPress website, search Curator, and hit Install. Make sure to activate the plugin. Then, you can copy short code and paste it where you want it to go instead of having to copy the long HTML code. Step 7. Review how the feed looks in your WordPress website After you embed the feed in your WordPress website, go ahead and check how it looks. If needed, go back to the Style section of Curator and make changes to your feed. If you're not using the WordPress plugin, you'll need to copy and paste the HTML code again. If you are using the plugin, you won't need to do that step again. Step 8. Occassionally approve or remove new Instagram posts Make sure to login to Curator occasionally to either delete or approve new posts. Depending on how often you post on Instagram, you might want to do this weekly or monthly How to embed your Instagram feed on a SquareSpace website To embed an Instagram feed on a SquareSpace website, the only step that is different than what described above is Step 6.

This way, customers can see UGC images of that exact product when deciding to purchase it. How to Add Instagram Posts from a Hashtag to Your Website Most website owners and developers want to add their own Instagram feed to their website. But what if you want to add posts from other Instagram users? Maybe you want to add posts from your customers to your website. To do this, simply choose Instagram Hashtags when selecting the type of content. This will pull in all posts tagged with that hashtag. Make sure to use manual approval and approve everything individually so you don't get the wrong types of images showing up on your website! Benefits of Adding Instagram Feeds The options for embedding Instagram feeds above do vary in difficulty. However, choosing the right one or even the right combination is beneficial for your brand and can strengthen your&nbsp;brand identity. Becoming an authority in your niche is crucial for gaining more organic traffic. Embedded Instagram feeds showcase your expertise on your website. For people who may not be on Instagram, this offers additional exposure to your expertise. Think of it as additional site content. Giving your visitors more is always a great idea. Plus, you're increasing the visibility of your Instagram posts. While Instagram's daily active user base is substantial, it's still not as huge as its parent company, Facebook, which has over a billion daily active users. Some of the biggest benefits of embedded Instagram feeds include: Embedded Instagram feeds are only effective, though, if you stay active on the platform. Don't forget, you can also embed more than just your own personal feed. Use hashtags to also embed feeds mentioning your brand. Just make sure you monitor posts to avoid irrelevant posts.
